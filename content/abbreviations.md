The catalogue entries of vessel and non-vessel glass objects presented in this publication adhere to the following format:

Catalogue number: Refers to an individual object or fragment of an object

The objects of the catalogue have been divided into two main groups, vessels and non-vessel artifacts. Vessels are presented first, grouped on the basis of their production technique, following chronologically the historical evolution of the glass technology, that is, core-formed, rod-formed, cast, slumped, rotary-pressed, and blown. Within each such group open shapes are presented first (plates, bowls, and beakers) and close-shaped vessels follow (amphoras, flasks, jugs, bottles, jars, and unguentaria), and examples of each shape are arranged chronologically. Non-vessel objects are presented at the end of the catalogue, organized in groups based on their use—appliqués, jewelry, spindle whorls, knucklebones, stirring rods, medical-alchemical implements, sculpture, and earplugs—chronologically arranged within each group.

Title: Usually a single word describing the shape or the use of the object

Accession_number: Getty inventory number

Inventoried glass objects are given a number that includes the year of accession. For objects acquired prior to 2000, two letters indicate the department and the material of the object, in most cases AF, referring to the departments of antiquities and glass, respectively, and a sequence number.

Dimensions: Measurements are given in centimeters. The following abbreviations are used:

H. = height (if the original orientation of the fragment is known)

L. = length

W. = width

Diam. = diameter

Th. = thickness

Wt. = weight (measurement given in grams)

dim. = dimension

max. = maximum

est. = estimated

pres. = preserved

In some catalogue entries, when the orientation of the fragment is uncertain or irrelevant, the dimensions are reported without prefixes: e.g., 0.60 × 0.40 × 0.20.

Date: Based on the comparanda, and given in a range of centuries or parts of centuries

Production area: Most of the objects lack any kind of information regarding their provenance, so production areas were deduced on the basis of comparanda that have been unearthed in controlled excavations and can provide such geographical indications.

Material: Color and quality of glass are described, noting first the degree of transparency (opaque, translucent, or transparent), followed by the color of the glass. The description of color always refers to the original color of the object and not to its present state, which may have been seriously affected by weathering.

Modeling technique and decoration: The techniques applied to the shaping and the decoration are noted, occasionally with further explanations referring to the steps of the procedure.

Condition: The state of preservation, the extent and nature of the different types of weathering, and the missing parts and occasional fills are noted. Those that are basically undamaged are considered “intact”; those that have been repaired without loss are considered “complete.”

Description. The overall form and the shape of each part of the vessel are described first, starting from the rim and moving toward the base. Unless stated to the contrary, there are no pontil marks. The description of the decoration, if any exists, follows.

Comments and Comparanda. For most of the catalogue entries, parallels are cited, and, whenever possible, some comments were added referring either to this particular object or to a whole group or class of objects that provide a context for the find.

Provenance: The recorded sequence of entities that owned the object prior to its acquisition by the Getty Museum

Bibliography: Any publication that the object was presented in

Exhibitions: Any exhibition that the object was presented in
