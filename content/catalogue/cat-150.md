## Condition

Mended. The surface of the glass is iridescent and pitted, and shows signs of flaking.

## Description

Rim mildly flaring; pinched and flattened cylindrical neck with a constriction at its base; squat, bulbous body with a flattened bottom.

The vessel appears to consist of about 20 rods fused together in a pattern—repeating at least seven times—of a wide blue rod flanked by fine white rods. The rods were slumped to form the closed shape of the vessel and tooled at least four times on each side, forming a distinct zigzag pattern.
