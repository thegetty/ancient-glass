## Condition

Single fragment, preserves two of the original edges that form a right angle.

## Description

In a dark blue matrix are partly preserved two yellow-and-white ribbed leaves and a small part of a red flower. On the back side behind the yellow leaves is a banded green, red, and white patch. The flower is a bit better visible there: it seems that it was quatrefoil and the petals are white outlined in red (like those in [2004.26.2](#cat) and [2004.26.5](#cat)).

## Comparanda

For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire see comments on [2003.260](#cat) and [2004.26.2](#cat).

## Provenance

By 1976, Bruce McNall, donated to the J.Â Paul Getty Museum, 1976
