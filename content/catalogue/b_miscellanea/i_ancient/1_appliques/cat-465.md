## Condition

Single fragment, preserves two of the original edges that form a right angle.

## Description

In a dark blue matrix are partly preserved two yellow-and-white ribbed leaves and a small part of a red flower. On the back side behind the yellow leaves is a banded green, red, and white patch. The flower is a bit better visible there: it seems that it was quatrefoil and the petals are white outlined in red (like those in {% cat '2004.26.2' %} and {% cat '2004.26.5' %}).

## Comparanda

For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire see comments on {% cat '2003.260' %} and {% cat '2004.26.2' %}.

## Provenance

By 1976, Bruce McNall, donated to the J.Â Paul Getty Museum, 1976
