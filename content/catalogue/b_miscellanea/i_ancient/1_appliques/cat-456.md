## Description

Decorative band with vertically arranged papyrus and lotus flowers. Only parts of both types of flowers appear on the preserved fragment. Namely, a conical red papyrus flower, outlined in yellow, standing on a thick stem made of dark blue and yellow rods. Lower is a lotus flower with pointed, flaring white petals and a pointed, conical central bud made of red glass outlined in white. Two vertical, yellow tendrils extend over the petals, ending in spirals.
