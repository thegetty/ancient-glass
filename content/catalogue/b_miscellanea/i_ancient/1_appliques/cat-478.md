## Description

In a translucent bluish matrix three flowers are visible. The first one has six yellow petals set in white arranged around a central yellow rod set in white. The second is round with a white square crossed by a translucent purple X, set in three concentric layers of yellow, becoming less intense toward the outer edge. The third has a wide central green rod surrounded by a layer of small purple dots set in yellow. Along one edge an elongated, striped feature is partly preserved.
