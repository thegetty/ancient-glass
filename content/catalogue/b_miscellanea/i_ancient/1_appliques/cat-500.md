## Condition

Single fragment; part of one edge is preserved.

## Description

Part of the representation of a fish. Rows of greenish and blue semicircular motifs, representing fish scales, outlined with a white straight band, probably the outline of the body, below which are obliquely arranged red and green sections on a dark blue background, probably a fin. On the back side the motifs are clearly visible, undistorted.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire see comments on [2003.260](#cat) and [2004.26.2](#cat). Of glass panels and vessels with mosaic fish motifs see comments and parallels cited for [2003.266](#cat).

In the rendering of the scales, the colors of the fins, and even the white outline of the body, 83.AF.28.26 is connected directly with fragments in the Corning Museum of Glass ([[ 1979]], p. 265, no. 794, plate 35; [[Harden et al. 1987]], p. 31, no. 9) and in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (<https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/570436>; <https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551563>).; [[Harden et al. 1987]], p. 31, no. 9: https://www.cmog.org/artwork/revetment-fish?image=0) and in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (<https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/570436>; <https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551563>).
