## Description

Milky white half-mask of Dionysus, set on a dark blue ground. Red hair rendered with tiny “black” spirals in red ground at upper part of the head and forehead; red and black vertical strands and three corkscrew locks at sideburns and below the neck. Eyebrow, eyelid, eye, and nose outlined in black. Small, open black mouth outlined in red. Indicating a wreath in the hair are four green, trilobed ivy leaves, outlined in yellow, along with an ivy flower-cluster, of green circles outlined in yellow and black. A green band, outlined in yellow and black, is on the forehead below the hair.
