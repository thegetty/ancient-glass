## Condition

Single fragment.

## Description

The fragment was cut into a square tile, probably in antiquity. Three sides are carefully [[grozzed]]; the edge of the fourth side is broken. The green body is decorated with yellow rods, which appear faintly, lengthwise, due to the distortion of the mass when it was formed by slumping.
