## Condition

Single fragment ground into a rectangular shape.

## Description

Floral features in a translucent dark blue-green matrix. A cluster of eight grapes hanging from a yellow stem. Each grape consists of yellow, white, and red semicircular features. One large, round flower with a red rod at the center surrounded by four white petals set in a green background, rendering the sepals. This is set in light green, white, and yellow layers. A larger plant with yellow stalk ending in a large, round flower, quite probably identical to the one described above. From the stalk stem four lanceolate leaves with a central red nerve; one half of the leaf is rendered in green and the other in turquoise glass.
