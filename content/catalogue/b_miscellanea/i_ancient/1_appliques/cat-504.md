## Description

A stamped, roughly discoid appliqué with a theater mask. Comical mask with small, circular eye-openings, wide-open smiling mouth, a prominent wig comprised of 26 radiantly arranged ribs, and a protuberance on the center of the forehead. Visible on the back side are traces of the strap handle and the body of the jug this once decorated.

## Comparanda

Discoid medallions decorated with molded relief motifs were used to embellish sumptuous tableware, predominantly jugs and bowls, from the first century CE and again in the third–fourth centuries CE ({% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, pp. 167–169, form 149). The medallion was usually placed on the base of the jug handle. Alternatively, it may have been added either singly or as one of a group of stamped bosses on the body of the vessel ({% cite 'von Saldern 1968' %}, no. 55; {% cite 'Isings 1964' %}, pp. 59–63; {% cite 'Harden et al. 1968' %}, p. 85, no. 112; {% cite 'Harden et al. 1987' %}, pp. 204–205, no. 113). In addition to theatrical masks, which have been associated with the role of the “hegemon therapon,” that is, the older, principal slave from Greek comedy ({% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005' %}, p. 429), the repertoire included heads of Medusa, Silenus, satyrs, and several objects connected to the cult of Dionysus (such as the thyrsus and Pan pipes), as well as lion heads.
