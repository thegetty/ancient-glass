## Condition

Fragment broken all around.

## Description

Mosaic inlay with floral motif. The basic motif, set in a checkerboard pattern, consists of a flower with four triangular green petals outlined in yellow, set in a red square with concave sides framed by four blue ovals outlined in white. Each tessera is lozenge-shaped, and along each center is placed the oval motif that stretches to the two corners. On each of the other two corners is a green triangle set in yellow. Four such tesserae form the quatrefoil flower motif, framed by ovals, which is set in a checkerboard pattern that covers the plaque.

Back side mainly murky green with some red areas only partly visible.
