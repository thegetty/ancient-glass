## Condition

Single fragment; two of the original, rounded edges preserved.

## Description

Wide, wavy bands of red, light green divided by three fine dark green lines and white glass. On one edge of this band a short, bending, applied, red feature is preserved.

## Comments and Comparanda

Possibly part of a maritime presentation, part of the body of a fish. Probably from the same object as [76.AF.70.16](#num) although that piece is thicker (Th. 0.5 cm). For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire see comments at [2003.260](#cat) and [2004.26.2](#cat). For maritime motifs on incrustations see comments on [2003.266](#cat).
