## Condition

Largely complete. Surface is covered with iridescence. Large fragments are missing around the edges above the head and under the chin.

## Description

Roughly circular appliqué medallion in the form of a lion’s head. Rich mane surrounds the head on all sides; aquiline snout; pronounced eyebrows; and wide-open mouth.

On the back side is preserved the part of the vessel body (Th. 0.1 cm) to which this was attached.

These medallions were mostly placed at the base of a jug handle, or around the body of a bowl.
