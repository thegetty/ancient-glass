## Condition

Severely weathered, covered by cream film. Most of it is grainy. The glass is visible only on the breakage at the lower end of the amulet. Parts of the plinth and the feet are missing.

## Description

Pendant in the shape of a nude female figure, probably the goddess Ishtar. Relief of a woman standing on a square plinth and holding her breasts. Hair is pulled back from forehead in vertical plaits and falls behind her ears to her neck. A broad necklace of elongated, vertical beads encircles her neck. Belly and hips accentuated. The forehead, where probably there was a headband, is severely weathered. The back side is flat but uneven. At the level of her breasts a horizontal thread hole was pierced through the bead.
