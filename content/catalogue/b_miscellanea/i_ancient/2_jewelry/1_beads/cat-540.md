## Condition

The bead shows signs of weathering and some discoloration. A crack runs down one side and there are a few abrasions.

## Description

Spherical bead. The central zone of the bead is decorated with a continuous frieze of two rows of adjoining lozenges, currently appearing white, bordering a central row of red lozenges, all flanked above and below by greenish triangles. All these motifs are outlined with a fine layer of glass, appearing black. Two dark blue bands form the upper and lower parts around the openings of the hole.
