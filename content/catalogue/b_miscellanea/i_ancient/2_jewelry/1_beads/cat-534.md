## Description

The necklace consists of 29 irregular globular face mosaic beads and one face pendant. Around the central part of each bead are female face mosaic florets that in most cases alternate with florets with geometrical patterns, arranged in a band. This central band is framed on top and bottom with a wide colored band of glass. Beads 1–4, 8–15, 18–19, 21–28, 30 have a vertical thread hole that tapers slightly upward. Beads 5–7, 17, 20, 29 have a vertical thread hole that tapers slightly downward.
