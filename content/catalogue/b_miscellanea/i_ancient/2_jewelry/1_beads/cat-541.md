Fully preserved, with minor scratches.

## Description

A cylindrical bead made of 20 circular tesserae arranged in four rows and roughly five columns. These slices were fused together as a flat mass and subsequently folded around a rod and rolled. The seam of this folding is still visible along the edge of the hole in the bead. Each tessera comprises the following: a thick white rod surrounded by finer red and white layers, in turn surrounded by a translucent green layer in which are arranged at equal distances ten minuscule white rods.
