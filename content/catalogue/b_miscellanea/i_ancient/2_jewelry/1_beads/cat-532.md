Vertical rectangular panel tapering toward the base; uneven flat back; straight sides, [bottom missing]; a large hole running horizontally through reel at top. Molded decoration on front: a series of two reels appear on the preserved fragment, the entire bead quite probably comprised three reels, each with a truncated pyramidal spike projecting out at the left; three pairs of wavy lines in relief run vertically down reels, with other, finer lines between spikes on left.
