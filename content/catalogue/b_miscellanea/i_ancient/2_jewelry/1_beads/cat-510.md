## Condition

Partly preserved.

## Description

Vertical rectangular panel tapering toward the base; uneven, flat back; straight sides, (bottom missing); a large hole running horizontally through volute at bottom. Molded decoration on front: a series of two volutes appear on the preserved fragment; the entire bead quite probably comprised three volutes, each with a truncated pyramidal spike projecting out at the left; three pairs of wavy lines in relief run vertically down reels, with another six finer lines between spikes on left.
