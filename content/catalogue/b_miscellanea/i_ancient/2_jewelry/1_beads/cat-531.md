## Description

Spacer-bead in the shape of a rectangular plaque. Each end pierced by a transverse thread hole. The underside is glossy and concave; the upper side is decorated with a raised, stylized motif of two argonauts placed back-to-back. The ribbed egg cases, or shells, cover the upper central part of the plaque. Three of the tentacles of each animal are presented curved and extending to the ends of each edge of the plaque; at the center of the plaque are the eyes.
