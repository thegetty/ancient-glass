## Condition

Thick, sturdy vessel. Neck is mended and probably belongs to a different vessel. Exterior partly iridescent; interior covered with incrustation.

## Description

Cut-off, vertical rim; conical neck; sloping shoulder. The body is everted and conical, standing on a slightly concave bottom. At the center of the bottom is the circular mark of a solid pontil (W. 1 cm). At mid-height on the body is a faint tooling mark.
