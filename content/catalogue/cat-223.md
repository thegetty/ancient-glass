In-folded, tubular, flaring rim; wide, conical mouth; cylindrical neck, wider toward the body. A constriction at the transition from the neck to the body forms a diaphragm. The globular body is covered with 22 well-defined, S-shaped mold-blown ribs. The vessel stands on a flat, slightly concave bottom. Annular pontil mark (W. 2.4, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.
