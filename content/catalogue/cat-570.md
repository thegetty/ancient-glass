## Comments and Comparanda

The solid glass rods known as stirring rods are quite sturdy implements and were used, or could have been used, for stirring drinks, such as wine with water, possibly in a specific context like banqueting. Nevertheless, they were probably used for other purposes as well, such as distaffs or spindles or else likenesses of distaffs and spindles. The majority of finds from controlled excavations are dated in the first and early second centuries CE, and are probably more common in the western than in the eastern areas of the Roman Empire. Stirring rods are usually twisted in one or two directions, and seldom smooth ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 94–95, form 79; {% cite 'Antonaras 2009' %}, pp. 330–332, form 148 = {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, pp. 166–167). Occasionally, examples like {% cat '82.AC.22.315' %} occur, with twisted shafts consisting of a main rod and a second, fine thread in a different color ({% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011' %}, pp. 330–331, no. 538; {% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, p. 312, no. 507; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 356–358, nos. 670c, e, h, l; {% cite 'Spaer 2001' %}, pp. 262–264, nos. 632, 634; pp. 330–331, nos. 536–539). In general, the ends of the rods were shaped in different ways. The simplest rods are straight, with a small disk attached at both ends. More elaborate types are often bent at one end, to form a closed ring, probably used as a handle, like this object, with a small disk attached at the other end. Occasionally on this disk a decorative finial—globular or of a more intriguing shape, e.g. of an amphora, bird, or dolphin—was applied ({% cite 'Fremersdorf and Polonyi-Fremersdorf 1984' %}, p. 111, no. 249; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 356–358, nos. 670c, e, h, l; {% cite 'Spaer 2001' %}, pp. 262–264, nos. 631–635; {% cite 'Stern 2001' %}, pp. 396–397, no. 228; {% cite 'Whitehouse 2003' %}, p. 52, nos. 971–972; {% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011' %}, pp. 306–307, 330–331, nos. 536–538; {% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, p. 312, no. 507).
