Intact. Remains of whitish core in the interior. Some crust on the handles.

## Description

Broad, horizontal rim-disk, slightly uneven on its upper side; very short, cylindrical neck; rounded shoulder; almost cylindrical, straight-sided body, tapering toward the neck; shallow, convex bottom. Below the shoulder, two opposing white ring handles with knobbed tails.

Opaque white body and handles; translucent purple decoration. An unmarvered purple thread is wound around the rim. A marvered purple thread is wound spirally around the upper half of the body, dragged upward to form a zigzag pattern. Below this a partly marvered thread is wound spirally three times.

## Comments and Comparanda

The alabastron (a narrow-necked flask) was one of the ceramic vessel forms that was rendered in glass by the core-forming technique from the sixth century BCE, when this technique, known in Mesopotamia and Egypt since the middle of the second millennium BCE, was introduced in the Aegean world. In addition to alabastra, amphoriskoi (small amphorae), aryballoi, and oinochoiskai (juglets) were also rendered in core-formed glass. It is believed that they functioned as unguentaria, intended for aromatic and cosmetic substances ({% cite 'Harden 1981' %}; {% cite 'McClellan 1984' %}; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 109–125; {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 37–44).

This alabastron belongs to the earliest group of Aegean core-formed vessels, dating from the middle of the sixth century to the end of the fifth century BCE ({% cite 'Harden 1981' %}, pp. 58–99; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 110–115). They were made either of blue glass and decorated with white, yellow, and turquoise threads or of milky white glass decorated with purple threads. Vessels of this group have been found in great numbers in Rhodes, Macedonia, the Aegean islands, and Italy. For the classification of this particular alabastron, see {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, class I:A, alabastron form I:2: pp. 133–134, nos. 65–68.
