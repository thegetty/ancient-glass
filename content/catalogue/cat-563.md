## Condition

Weathering has given parts a purple iridescence, and there is some incrustation in places.

## Description

The bracelet is made of a rod of glass, D-shaped in cross section, that was bent to form a closed circle. The area where the two ends meet was flattened to form a medallion. There are no signs of painted or other decoration on any part of it. A groove runs along part of the inside surface.
