## Condition

Intact; iridescent sheen on the exterior and dark accretion on the interior.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; relatively wide, cylindrical neck; bulbous body; slightly concave bottom. The body is covered with a mold-blown honeycomb pattern in twelve rows of hexagonal cells.

## Comments and Comparanda

The mold-blown honeycomb pattern appears in the third and fourth centuries CE on Syrian sprinklers like {% cat '2003.335' %}. The tint and the overall quality of the glass of 2003.338, however, does not fit with that of Late Roman products; it rather seems closer to Islamic glassware. Mold-blown flasks with wide neck and globular body decorated with the honeycomb pattern, among other motifs, are also known from the Abbasid and Fatimid periods. See examples from Fustat ({% cite 'Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001' %}, p. 76, forms 36-f, 36-g) and Egypt ({% cite 'Clairmont 1977' %}: for the decoration, see p. 64, no. 204; for the shape p. 65, no. 209).
