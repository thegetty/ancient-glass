## Comments and Comparanda

Shallow bowls and bottles made of sealing-wax red glass, occasionally with a reddish-brown tint and dark brown or black veins running through it, have been plausibly proposed to have been made in Palestine, and they are dated in the eighth–ninth centuries CE ({% cite 'Carboni and Whitehouse 2001' %}, pp. 16–17; {% cite 'Brosh 2004' %}). They have been found in excavations at Hama ({% cite 'Riis 1957' %}, pp. 48, 61, fig. 178), Jerusalem ({% cite 'Brosh 2004' %}, pp. 54–55), and Corinth ({% cite 'Davidson 1952' %}, pp. 107–109, 112, 116, 121, nos. 694, 699, 730, 759, 802, 807) and they are also noted in museum collections, namely in Eretz Israel Museum ({% cite 'Brosh 2004' %}, p. 54; {% cite 'Carboni and Whitehouse 2001' %}, p. 17, fig. 2), the Kuwait National Museum ({% cite 'Carboni 2001' %}, p. 153, nos. 3.3.a–h), the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford ({% cite 'Brosh 2004' %}, p. 54), and previously in the Smith Collection ({% cite '*Glass from the Ancient World* 1957' %}, p. 201, no. 398) and the Benzian Collection ({% cite 'Benzian 1994' %}, p. 105, no. 195).
