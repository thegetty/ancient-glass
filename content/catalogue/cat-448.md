## Description

Cast inlay in the form of a right human eye. The eye is outlined in blue glass and has an opaque white sclera, and the pupil is black and lentoid in cross section.

## Comments and Comparanda

On Pharaonic Egyptian glass inlays in general, see comments on {% cat '2003.149' %}. Inlaid eyes were often used in statues and statuettes, mummies, mummy masks, and coffins. It is not only human mummies that had inlaid eyes, but those of animals as well, when they were considered personifications of deities or otherwise connected to deities, like the sacred bull Apis ({% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 174–175, no. 27; {% cite 'Lucas and Harris 1962' %}, pp. 124–127).
