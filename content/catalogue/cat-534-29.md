## Condition

Intact

## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are opaque white, possibly weathered green. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible. The two bands are applied onto this surface. Inside the thread hole, it can be seen that the back side of the mosaic sections slid toward the upper opening of the hole and was covered by the single-colored band. There are three Medusa heads set in a fine round white frame, set in a larger, square blue field. The additional plaques are three square tiles. In each one are set, in a translucent dark blue field, two yellow, one green, and one red triangles, all facing toward the center.
