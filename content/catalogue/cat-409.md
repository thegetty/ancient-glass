## Condition

Intact. Some weathering that has caused iridescence.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; conical neck with large bulge under the rim and a smaller one at its base; elongated, conical body, narrowing to a small flat bottom with a pontil scar (W. 0.5 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

Vessels of this shape are known as “spearhead flasks” due to the tapering of the body toward the narrow bottom. They were recognized as containers for kohl, a cosmetic substance for the decoration of the eyelids, which was archaeologically attested in different sites in Israel and the Sinai Peninsula ({% cite 'Brosh 1993' %}; {% cite 'Shindo 1992' %}, pp. 303–304).

Predecessors of the spearlike flasks with pointed body but smooth neck are known and have been dated between the seventh and ninth centuries ({% cite 'Goldstein et al. 2005' %}, p. 67, no. 55, pp. 72–73, no. 67). The spearhead flasks have been dated from the eighth to the twelfth centuries. In addition to the numerous undecorated free-blown examples (e.g., {% cite 'Auth 1976' %}, p. 231, nos. 534–536, esp. no. 535; {% cite 'Dzanpoladian and Kalantarian 1988' %}, p. 24, no. 55, plate XLIII:7; {% cite 'Arakelian, Tiratzian, and Khachatrian 1969' %}, p. 64, no. 148; {% cite 'von Saldern 1974' %}, p. 243, no. 381; {% cite 'Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001' %}, p. 43, forms 18a–d; {% cite 'Foy 2020' %}, pp. 68–69 type Sb44; {% cite 'Goldstein et al. 2005' %}, p. 222, no. 256; {% cite 'Whitehouse 2014' %}, pp. 51–53, nos. 671, 674, 676; {% cite 'Hadad 2005' %}, pp. 40–41, 164–165, plate 38:784–786), there are published several examples with marvered decoration ({% cite 'Lamm 1930' %}, plate 32:5–7; {% cite 'Harden 1955' %}, p. 63, no. 14, fig. 37; {% cite 'Whitecomb 1983' %}, p. 102, fig. 2.cc, ee, mm, nn; {% cite 'Taniichi 1987' %}, pp. 53, 90, no. 108; {% cite 'von Saldern 1968' %}, no. 69, plate 68; {% cite 'Carboni and Whitehouse 2001' %}, p. 139, no. 55; {% cite 'Carboni 2001' %}, pp. 304–305, nos. 80a–c; {% cite 'Goldstein et al. 2005' %}, p. 261, nos. 300–303) and with spiraling or vertical ribbing ({% cite 'Carboni 2001' %}, p. 242, no. 3.29a; {% cite 'Whitehouse 2014' %}, pp. 105, 114, no. 805) and with mold-blown motifs ({% cite 'von Saldern 1968' %}, p. 94, no. 68; {% cite 'Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001' %}, p. 43, form 18e; {% cite 'Whitehouse 2014' %}, pp. 105, 107–108, nos. 788, 792).
