## Description

The pendant is arybaloid in shape. It has a spherical body with the thread hole on the neck at the transition to the flat, discoid upper part. It is made of opaque green mass. On the upper surface a red or mosaic core is visible. The base mass is light green. On the upper surface is visible a spiraling red and “black” core. A thread hole that sets the faces on the pendant is off-axis. There are three faces of Medusas in a fine white, round field set in dark blue squares, each one flanked by a rectangular plaque. The additional plaques are three squares filled with four colorful triangular elements facing to the center, each one outlined by translucent greenish glass: two yellow facing each other, and one red and one green facing each other.
