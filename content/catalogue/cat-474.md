Single fragment broken all around.

## Description

The following floral features are partly preserved on a translucent dark blue (appearing black) background: two long stems with five rows of green and turquoise lanceolate leaves; two quatrefoil white and red flowers; three yellow rods set in white spots, probably buds or grains.

Most of the motifs are distorted on the back side.
