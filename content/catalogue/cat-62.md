## Condition

Intact, with some areas of iridescence. There are a few minor nicks and scratches. The body, both interior and exterior, is covered with circular scratches.

## Description

Bowl with a slightly flared, uneven lip. The rim is accentuated in the interior with a fine groove running 0.3 cm below the lip. At the center of the tiny resting surface is one dot, surrounded by a thick ring, which is encircled by a fine, thin ring.

## Comments and Comparanda

No exact parallels have been noted. The bowl, however, belongs to a group of high-quality Hellenistic tableware vessels, predominantly plates, hemispherical bowls—sometimes footed or finned (e.g., {% cat '2003.215' %})—and skyphoi found in burials in Canosa, the ancient Canusium in southern Italy (for an overview of Canosa Group vessels, see {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 97–115). The vessels belong to two main groups: Millefiori Mosaic Glass and Cast Monochrome Tablewares, the latter made of decolorized, occasionally gilded glass or of strongly colored deep blue and light blue or purple glass ({% cite 'Oliver 1968' %}, pp. 48–55; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 185–189). Occasionally they were decorated with lathe-cut bands or grooves, or gilding; a very few had gold-leaf designs set between two fine colorless bowls in a sandwich gold-glass technique. They have been dated between the late third and the late second century BCE, although individual vessels of all hoards range from the late third to the late first century BCE ({% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 100–102). This particular bowl was made of heavily colored glass by chip casting ({% cite 'Lierke 2009' %}, pp. 27–29; {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 49–53, 110–111).

Relatively similar (in respect to the flanged rim and the groove along the rim) are footed bowls made of decolorized glass, although admittedly having a more conical body shape (see {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 102–104, figs. 177, 189–191, also pp. 256–259, nos. 67–68), all of them dated to the second or perhaps to the first century BCE.
