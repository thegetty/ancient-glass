## Condition

Two fragments. Parts of three straight original edges forming a right angle are preserved.

## Description

Plaque or band with vertical floral pattern. Parts of two rows of decorative leaves appear in dark blue matrix in the preserved fragments. The elongated leaves are green and yellow outlined in translucent purple (appearing black). One half of the leaf is rendered with darker green glass and the other half with lighter, yellowish green glass, as if part of the plant was in shadow and the other in direct sunlight.

On the back side the same motifs appear, distorted, and in big areas covered by translucent purple glass.
