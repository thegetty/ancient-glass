## Condition

Two joining pieces. Fragment preserving two straight edges that form a right angle, probably from the original shaping of the object.

## Description

On dark blue matrix a central yellow stem with turquoise and green lanceolate leaves (like those on {% cat '76.AF.70.29' %}) and a small part of a red flower, probably identical with that of {% cat '83.AF.28.21' %}.
