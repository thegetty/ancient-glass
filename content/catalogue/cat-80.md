## Condition

Intact. A few areas of discoloration and iridescence on both the interior and the exterior. Rotary scratches present on the entire vessel, particularly visible on both sides of the bottom.

## Description

Flared rim, rounded by grinding and polishing; cylindrical body; small, uneven, flaring base-ring; flat bottom. The bottom has been lathe-cut to form a flared base-ring, a fine ring 1 cm wide, and a boss in the center of the underside. There are two fine, lathe-cut grooves in the rim on the interior.
