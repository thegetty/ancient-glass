## Condition

Intact. Some iridescence on the interior; few pinprick bubbles.

## Description

Horizontal rim, folded out, down, and up, with an overhanging flange; short, cylindrical neck; thick-walled, spherical body; flat, slightly concave bottom. A pair of flat strap handles extend from the shoulder to halfway up the neck. The body is made of translucent purple glass, and the handles of transparent greenish glass.

The entire body is covered with picked-up color chips, that is, the splashware technique. The translucent purple glass {% def 'paraison' %} was marvered to incorporate flakes of variously colored glass chips (opaque white, yellow, light blue, turquoise, and dark blue). The vessel was subsequently inflated, whereby the chips were distorted in the areas of greatest expansion.

## Comments and Comparanda

The form is known in core-formed glass vessels from the sixth century BCE ({% cat '2003.174' 'cats. 53' %}–{% cat '2003.176' '56' %}). Free-blown glass aryballoi are a well-represented form of globular flasks used to store and transport cosmetic oils in the first and second centuries CE. There are a few variants, identifiable in the shape of the rim.
