## Comments and Comparanda

These vessels render naturalistically the fruit of the palm tree (*Phoenix dactylifera*), dates. The entire surface of the vessel is covered by wrinkles, similar to those of a ripe date, and its size, which is approximately 7 cm, is also identical to the size of many of these fruits. Generally this is a widely known and distributed form of unguentarium ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, p. 94, form 78d; {% cite 'Antonaras 2009' %} = {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, pp. 141–142, form 117) that appears in many regions of the Roman Empire.
