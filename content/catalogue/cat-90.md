## Description

The bowl has a flaring lip; conical, cyma recta body; and flat bottom. It stands on a tall, circular ring-base formed by a single revolution of an applied coil of glass.

The vessel is made of discoid mosaic tesserae, with florets mostly of the following five types: (1) a central yellow rod surrounded in turn by red, blue, white, and blue layers; (2) a central yellow rod surrounded in turn by blue, red, white, and blue layers; (3) a central white rod set in red, surrounded by a dark blue layer with ten white rods, which in turn is surrounded by a blue layer; (4) a central white rod set in red, surrounded by a dark blue layer with ten yellow rods, which in turn is surrounded by a blue layer; (5) a central red rod surrounded in turn by white, blue, white, and blue layers of glass.

In addition, one tessera of the following type of floret appears: a central green rod surrounded in turn by yellow, red, white, and blue layers of glass.

The coil of the base is ribbon mosaic comprising roughly ten parallel layers of glass in red, white, and blue.
