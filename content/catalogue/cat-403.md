## Comments and Comparanda

This is a very simple form of utilitarian vessel that was produced at many sites in the Islamic world, its shape was suitable for meeting everyday needs without any particular modifications. A similar vessel was found in Fustat, Egypt ({% cite 'Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001' %}, p. 31, form 10a), and Nishapur, Iran ({% cite 'Kröger 1995' %}, pp. 72–73, nos. 90–92); another is in the Newark Museum ({% cite 'Auth 1976' %}, p. 164, no. 220). Cf. also {% cite 'von Saldern 1974' %}, p. 221, no. 336, for a parallel decorated with an applied thread.
