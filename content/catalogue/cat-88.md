## Condition

Mended; fully preserved; small chipping on the rim filled.

## Description

The bowl has an upright rounded lip; cylindrical body tapering toward the flat bottom. It stands on a tall, conical base-ring formed by a single revolution of an applied ribbon coil of glass, which consists of at least 10 layers of translucent purple and opaque turquoise and green glass.

The rim is a twisted purple and white rope-like cane. The vessel is made of a matrix comprising four types of circular mosaic sections, florets, fused together.

The first type of floret, which is the most numerous, consists of a yellow central rod surrounded by 17 translucent purple, trapezoidal petals outlined with white.

The second, quite numerous type of floret consists of a purple central rod surrounded by 13 yellow, trapezoidal petals outlined in white.

The third, less numerous type of floret consists of a thin central purple rod set in a thicker layer of white glass, surrounded by 13 translucent green, trapezoidal petals outlined in yellow.

The fourth type of floret appears with only one example and consists of a central green rod set in a thin layer of yellow glass surrounded by 13 translucent purple, trapezoidal petals outlined in white.

The fifth type of floret appears in a fragment of a floret, and consists of a central turquoise rod surrounded by a layer of translucent purple glass with white rods arranged in it—seven in the preserved part of the floret—flanked with white, which is set in a turquoise layer.

The typology of canes used for the production of the vessel includes two types of twisted cane, one made of opaque white and translucent turquoise glass, and the other of opaque white and translucent purple glass

## Comments and Comparanda

See comments on {% cat '85.AF.85' %}.

Different forms of Hellenistic mosaic bowls are known, and three different kinds of mosaic (network, striped, or ribbon and composite mosaic) were used for their production ({% cite 'Weinberg 1965' %}; {% cite 'Oliver 1968' %}; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 189–197; and more recently {% cite 'Lightfoot 2019' %}). The production center for mosaic and network mosaic vessels remains unknown, although a proposed location is Alexandria, Egypt ({% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2000' %}, pp. 18, 140).

This particular bowl belongs to a group of late Hellenistic glass mosaic vessels: non-carinated, convex-sided mosaic bowls with a tall splaying base, examples of which have been recovered from a shipwreck that sank about 80 BCE off the island of Antikythera in the Aegean Sea, carrying a diverse cargo traveling from the eastern Mediterranean to Italy ({% cite 'Weinberg 1965' %}; {% cite 'Weinberg and McClellan 1992' %}, pp. 28–33; {% cite 'Avronidaki 2012' %}, pp. 140–145). A few similar non-carinated, convex-sided mosaic bowls, occasionally with a splayed base, have been very scarcely noted among Roman mosaic vessels dating from the late first century BCE to the early first century CE ({% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 253–254: “composite mosaic vessels with applied rims”).
