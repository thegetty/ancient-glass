Intact. Small parts covered with brownish weathering and iridescence.

## Description

Cracked-off and ground, slightly uneven rim; conical body, standing on a flat bottom. Under the rim, two fine, horizontal wheel-cut grooves flank a row of sparsely arranged rice-shaped, wheel-cut incisions. Further below, the body is covered with six rows of loosely arranged wheel-cut incisions, which leave small lozenge-shaped flat areas among them. The four upper rows comprise oval incisions, and the lower two are circular. On the bottom is a central circular incision surrounded by a row of six oval incisions.
