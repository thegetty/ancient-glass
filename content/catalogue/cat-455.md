## Condition

Fragment. A missing part has been filled with resin. Front side seems to have been polished in modern times. On the back, the lower part is covered by a glassy layer.

## Description

Rectangular inlay, broken on both ends. Front and back sides flat. The design extends through the thickness of the plaque. The upper part is uneven but clear and the motifs are clearly visible. Only the left edge is straight and probably preserves the original edge of the band.

Part of an elongated decorative band with palmettes, the fan-shaped leaves of a palm tree. In the preserved part, the same motif appears partially three times: palmette with six leaves and yellow lanceolate stem standing on two spiral tendrils. The motif is outlined in white glass on a dark blue background, and only the palmette stem is made of opaque yellow glass. The lower preserved palmette differs in the red used in an oval at the upper end of the lanceolate stem and at the outer edges of the petals.
