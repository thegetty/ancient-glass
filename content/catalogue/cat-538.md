## Description

A spherical bead made of seven circular blue and seven or eight rectangular yellow slices of composite mosaic canes arranged in three rows and roughly five columns. These slices were fused together as a flat mass and were subsequently folded around a rod and pressed at the edges, forming a globular bead. The seam of this folding is still visible along the bead. Each circular floret contains an eight-petaled rosette. A central yellow rod is enclosed in a red layer, which is surrounded by eight white triangular petals fused in dark blue glass. Each square floret contains a checkerboard motif set in a layer of red glass. The checkerboard comprises six columns with six rows of square, tiny, alternately greenish and yellow tesserae.
