## Condition

Fragment, broken all around.

## Description

A flat fragment that has been repolished and lost part of its surface on both sides. Some mild curvature is still present, indicating that the fragment is part of a vessel. On the fragment are tesserae of a single type: a rosette with two layers of petals constructed of a central red rod surrounded by six turquoise trapezoidal petals, all of them set in white, and an outer layer of seven petals, each one consisting of a central yellow rod set in translucent purple glass.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the production technique see comments on {% cat '85.AF.85' %}. On the trade of small fragments of mosaic glass in the nineteenth century and on the different techniques and classes of mosaic glass present in the Getty collection, see comments on {% cat '76.AF.70.21' %}. This fragment quite probably belongs to the same vessel as {% cat '83.AF.28.8' %}.
