Single fragment.

## Description

The vessel was made of florets of one single type: a red central rod, surrounded by seven green petals outlined in yellow, surrounded by a layer of 12 white rods set in a purple background. On one side the florets appear correctly, while on the other side some of the florets have been distorted and the rods appear as white lengths in purple background.
