## Condition

Single fragment, broken all around.

## Description

Convex fragment of the lower part of a curved vessel, probably a bowl. The preserved part of the vessel consists of multicolored tesserae. The fragment was deformed by fire. The tesserae appear quite unusual at first glance, but closer inspection identifies in them deformed and discolored features of the floral motifs that appear in the plaques with the Nilotic flora, such as {% cat '2004.26.2' %}.
