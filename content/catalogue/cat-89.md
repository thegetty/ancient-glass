## Condition

A number of repaired breaks are visible, and there are some nicks and scratches. There is discoloration and weathering on the interior surface. The base is totally weathered, possibly originally greenish.

## Description

The bowl has a slightly flared lip; conical, cyma recta body; and flat bottom. It stands on a tall, circular ring-base formed by an applied coil of glass, possibly green.

The vessel is made of a matrix comprising a single type of hexagonal mosaic section fused together. Each of these florets consists of eight concentric layers, in turn white, red, fine purple, yellow line, thicker purple, fine grayish white, purple, and white.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the production technique see {% cite 'Dawes 2002' %} and comments on {% cat '85.AF.85' %}. Cast, angular vessels are a very characteristic type for the early Roman period class of glass finewares. Among them, carinated, cast bowls are a quite widespread vessel shape, made of single-colored ({% cat '2003.232' 'cats. 75' %}–{% cat '2003.234' '77' %}) and mosaic opaque glass ({% cat '2003.248' 'cats. 90' %}–{% cat '2003.250' '92' %}) in striking colors, and slightly later of translucent glass ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, form 2). They were probably produced in Italy, and also probably in the eastern Mediterranean. The earlier examples have the constriction near the middle of the body, and the later near the rim, like the examples in the Getty Collection, indicating that they were probably produced in the second quarter of the century ({% cite 'Stern 1979' %}, pp. 63–72, plate 6; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 257–258; {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 65, 328–331, nos. 99–101). Mosaic bowls of this shape have been reported at many northwestern European sites (many of them listed in {% cite 'van Lith 1977' %}, p. 13; and {% cite 'Czurda-Ruth 1979' %}, pp. 69–70). In addition, eastern Mediterranean finds include Damascus and Hama ({% cite 'Abdul-Hak and Abdul-Hak 1951' %}, plate LVII.2a,c; {% cite 'Zouhdi 1964' %}, pp. 71–72, 73–78, figs. 19–20); Beirut ({% cite 'Baramki 1967' %}, p. 64, plate V.6); Dura Europos ({% cite 'Toll, Bellinger, and Ivanovič Rostovcev 1946' %}, p. 56, no. 8, plate 46); Meroë, Sudan ({% cite 'Stern 1981' %}, pp. 38, no. 19, fig. 2.19); and Heis, Somalia ({% cite 'Stern 1987' %}, p. 26, figs. 3.4, 4.5). Further examples are kept in several museums in Israel ({% cite 'Israeli 2003' %}, pp. 83, nos. 81–82), the USA ({% cite 'Goldstein 1979' %}, pp. 184–188, nos. 491–500; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 311–325, nos. 449–525; {% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, p. 68, no. 67), Canada ({% cite 'Hayes 1975' %}, pp. 24–25, nos. 59–63, plate 5), and Japan ({% cite 'Miho Museum 2001' %}, p. 70, no. 82).
