## Comments and Comparanda

Kohl tubes are widely distributed in the Syro-Palestinian region, found mostly in tombs dated between the middle of the fourth and sixth centuries CE ({% cite 'Barag 1970a' %}, pp. 175−177, types 12:2–3, plate 39:2, 3; {% cite 'Dussart 1998' %}, pp. 173–175, types B.XIII.2211–2232; {% cite 'Gorin-Rosen and Katsnelson 2007' %}, pp. 36–42). The basic concept of the vessel is always the same: a glass tube bent to form a vessel with two parallel compartments. Variants with one, two, or even more tubes are known, with or without handles. Their content and use are evident because in some cases remains of kohl and/or metal or bone applicators were found in them ({% cite 'Seligman et al. 1996' %}, p. 50). This particular type with elaborate handles has been dated to the fifth century CE ({% cite 'Barag 1970a' %}, pp. 177−178, type 12:5–1, plate 39:5–1; {% cite 'Gorin-Rosen and Katsnelson 2007' %}, p. 42).
