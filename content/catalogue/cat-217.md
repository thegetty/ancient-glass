## Condition

Fully preserved; small chips missing on the body. Areas covered with weathering and accretions.

## Description

Neck and body blown in a two-part mold of two vertical sections. Edges of mold not very carefully aligned. One continuous mold seam, around body and base, extends onto either side of neck and follows the line of vertical ribs on body.

Fire-polished, horizontal rim; short, cylindrical neck; globular, melon-shaped body covered with 12 wide, vertical, mold-blown ridges; circular, flat base. An olive-green bifurcated strap handle has been applied on the shoulder and drawn up to the lip with projecting thumb-rest tab above. Handle placement not adjacent to the seam.
