## Condition

Single fragment broken all around.

## Description

The following floral features are partly preserved on a translucent dark green (appearing black) background: one large white and red flower and another whose center is a fine green cross surrounded by yellow, white, greenish, and yellow layers; a cluster of five white and red grains hanging from a curved green branch.

Parts of a lotus seed pod: circular green in the center surrounded by purple dots outlined in yellow. Turquoise elongated feature, probably part of a leave or a petal.

All motifs are distorted on the back side, appearing variegated.
