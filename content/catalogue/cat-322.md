## Condition

Lower part of the body and neck restored.

## Description

In-folded and flattened, flaring rim; in its current state, short neck; biconical body. A white trail of glass has been spirally wound approximately 15 times from the bottom to the rim and dragged upward four times, forming an irregular feathering pattern. The trail was tooled and melted flush with the vessel surface. The neck originally was probably much longer, as it is in all cited parallels.

## Comments and Comparanda

Tear- or drop-shaped flasks for unguents are a relatively widespread form of unguentarium, dated to the first century CE. This particular variant is considered to be an eastern Mediterranean product. They are either plain or decorated with a fine thread of glass, either left in relief, as in {% cat '2003.415' 'cats. 332' %}–{% cat '2003.416' '333' %}, or marvered flush, as in this vessel.

Published examples include several plain ones from Pompeii ({% cite 'Scatozza Höricht 2012' %}, p. 140, no. 11294A, plate XXVIII); Venice ({% cite 'Larese 2004' %}, no. 393, plate XI); Cyprus ({% cite 'McFadden 1946' %}, p. 486, no. 114, plate 45; {% cite 'Vessberg 1952' %}, p. 141, plate IX:30); Amphipolis ({% cite 'Weinberg 1963' %}, pp. 1–2); Palestine ({% cite 'Barag 1970a' %}, vol. 2, type XXII:2); Adana region ({% cite 'Stern 1989' %}, p. 590, fig. 10:5–8); Amorgos ({% cite 'Weinberg and McClellan 1992' %}, pp. 115–116, no. 80); Aquileia ({% cite 'Mandruzzato and Marcante 2007' %}, pp. 104, 139, nos. 289–290); and unprovenanced ({% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, p. 214, no. 323).

In addition, unprovenanced examples decorated with a trail left in relief are reported from several museums: {% cite 'Whitehouse 2001a' %}, p. 170, no. 702; {% cite '3000 Jahre Glaskunst' %}, p. 220, no. 638; {% cite 'Bomford 1976' %}, p. 20, no. 57; {% cite 'Fleming 1999' %}, p. 30; {% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, p. 214, no. 324. Parallels with trails marvered and dragged upward include the following unprovenanced examples: {% cite 'Stern 2001' %}, p. 62, no. 6; {% cite 'Matheson 1980' %}, pp. 24–25, no. 65; {% cite 'Oliver 1980' %}, pp. 52, 56, nos. 37–38.
