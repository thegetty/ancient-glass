## Comments and Comparanda

In ancient Egypt prefabricated, colorful glass inlays were often used as parts of decorative composite reliefs in figural scenes and inscriptions on wooden, ivory, and stone objects such as shrines, statues and statuettes, mummies, mummy masks, coffins, and expensive furniture. The body parts of the kings were rendered mostly in red and those of the gods in blue-greenish glass. These inlays either protruded in relief or were placed in individual cells half- or completely sunken in the surface of the object. They appeared from the Eighteenth Dynasty, during the reign of Amenhotep III (1387–1350 BCE) ({% cite 'Cooney 1960' %}, pp. 11–33; {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, p. 143, comments on no. 11).
