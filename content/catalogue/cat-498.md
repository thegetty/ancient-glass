## Condition

Single fragment; two of the original, rounded edges preserved.

## Description

Wavy lines of green and yellow glass converging toward the edge, which is not preserved. On one edge of this band a tiny remnant of a red feature is preserved. The motifs are visible, partly distorted, on the back side of the plaque.

## Comments and Comparanda

Possibly part of a maritime presentation, part of the body of a fish. Probably from the same object as {% cat '76.AF.70.14' %}, although that piece is only 0.2 cm thick. For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire, see comments on {% cat '2003.260' 'cats. 449' %} and {% cat '2004.26.2' '460' %}. For maritime motifs on incrustations, see comments on {% cat '2003.266' %}.

## Provenance

By 1976, Bruce McNall, donated to the J.Â Paul Getty Museum, 1976
