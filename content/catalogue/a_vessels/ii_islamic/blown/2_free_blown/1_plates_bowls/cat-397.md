## Comparanda

Conical bowls are a very popular shape among Islamic glassware. They occur either undecorated like this example, or with mold-blown motifs, such as ribs or crosshatching (cf. [[von Saldern 1974]], pp. 207–209, nos. 312–317; [[Kröger 1995]], p. 93, no. 130). Parallels include finds from Fustat ([[Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001]], pp. 23–24, 26 form 2e, or 5b) and museum collections, such as Kunstpalast Düsseldorf ([[von Saldern 1974]], p. 352, nos. 349–350), and the Corning Museum of Glass ([[Whitehouse 2014]], p. 33, nos. 638–639). The thickened rim and the flat bottom link this bowl to a form of bowls with vertical sides that have this type of rim and bottom; they are dated to the tenth century, e.g., [[Kröger 1995]], p. 45, nos. 11–12.
