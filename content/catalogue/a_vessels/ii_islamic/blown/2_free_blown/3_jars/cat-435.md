## Condition

Covered with a layer of iridescent weathering, which is thicker around the neck.

## Description

Flaring, fire-polished rim; a simple constriction indicates the transition to the body. Convex shoulder and everted, conical body. The body has been pressed all around ten times, gaining thus an irregular decagonal shape. The bottom is flat, and two deep scars and parts of an annular pontil mark (W. 1.1 cm) are visible on it.
