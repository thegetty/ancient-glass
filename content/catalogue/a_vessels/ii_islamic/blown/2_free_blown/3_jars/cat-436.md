## Condition

Intact; most of the vessel is covered with iridescent and in other areas milky white weathering. A few pinprick bubbles, no impurities.

## Description

The vessel has a flaring, fire-polished rim; practically no neck at all, just a constriction leading to the ovular body. The lower part of the body is folded, forming a tubular base-ring. The bottom of the vessel is mildly concave, and at the center of the undersurface the scar of a solid pontil (Diam. 0.6 cm) is visible.

## Comments and Comparanda

This particular variant of globular jar with a pushed-in ring-base is known from excavations at Fustat, an area of medieval Cairo in Egypt ({% cite 'Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001' %}, pp. 50–51, type 22c, from a pit dated in the early eleventh century). For simpler globular jars, see comments on {% cat '2003.384' %}.

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
