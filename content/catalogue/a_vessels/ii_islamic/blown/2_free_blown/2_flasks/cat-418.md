Mended. Adhesive join at neck. Resin/adhesive embedded with chunks of weathering from glass cover on the neck. The neck and body are likely from different objects. Iridescence on the exterior. Incrustation on the interior.

## Description

Flat, cut-off rim; short, wide, cylindrical neck, wider toward the body. Sloping shoulder with an overblow visible on two of the sides; prismatic body, almost square in cross section, with cut edges, which turn it into an octagon. The body walls taper toward the flat bottom. At the center of the bottom the circular scar of a solid pontil (W. 1.2 cm) is visible.
