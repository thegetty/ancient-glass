## Condition

Pastiche of two different vessels. The two parts are mended at the bottom of the neck. Exterior partly iridescent; interior covered with incrustation.

## Description

In-folded, flattened, flaring rim; cylindrical neck; sloping shoulder; cylindrical body tapering toward the bottom; slightly concave bottom. Round mark of a solid pontil (W. 1.2 cm) at the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

The neck and rim part probably belong to a Roman flask, likely conical with long neck, made in Egypt that can be dated in the late first–second century CE ([[Edgar 1905]], plate VIII, no. 32.640; [[Harden 1936]], plate XX, no. 797; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 222, no. 347).

The body belongs to an Islamic flask ([[Lamm 1930]], plate 3:36; [[Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001]], p. 42, form 17e). {% cat '79.AF.184.6' %} has a quite similar body shape.

## Provenance

1979, Edwin A. Lipps, 1922–1988 (Pacific Palisades, California), donated to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 1979
