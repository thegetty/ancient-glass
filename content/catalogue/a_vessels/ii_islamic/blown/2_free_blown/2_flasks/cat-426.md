## Condition

Upper part of the neck missing. Iridescence and incrustation on both the exterior and the interior.

## Description

Vertical, fire-polished rim; short, wide, cylindrical neck, with one constriction visible at the top of the preserved part; mildly sloping shoulder; short, cylindrical body, curving in at bottom; slightly concave bottom. An annular pontil mark (W. 0.8 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom. On the neck a small trace of what could be either a fine thread wound on the rim or a tooling mark; probably the latter.
