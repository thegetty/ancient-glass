## Condition

Fully preserved. Cracked and mended. Bluish-gray surface in areas with calcination; black and off-white weathering. Interior covered with a black layer of weathering.

## Description

Flat, fire-polished rim, smooth at the periphery, rough toward the opening, probably as a result of weathering. Globular neck and sphero-conical body; small, flat bottom, possibly the area where the pontil was attached.

## Comparanda

This vessel belongs to a group of thick-walled glass flasks that have been identified with “grenades.” Ceramic “grenades” of the same shape and size, sometimes with molded decoration, are well known in the Islamic word ([[Ettinghausen 1965]], pp. 218–229), for which it has been assumed that they were either actual grenades, or that they were used for the transportation of valuable liquids, or, more plausibly, that they were beer containers ([fuqqāʿa]{.underline} in Arabic) ([[Ghouchani and Adle 1992]], pp. 72–92; [[Whitehouse 2014]], pp. 92–93, no. 767). For other glass parallels see: [[Mostafa 1959]], pp. 89–92; [[Ettinghausen 1965]], pp. 218–229; [[von Saldern et al. 1974]], p. 255, no. 746; [[Maddison and Savage-Smith 1997]], nos. 210, 211; [[Carboni 2001]], pp. 212–213, no. 53b; [[Valiulina 2005]], p. 48, fig. 21:3; [[Whitehouse 2014]], pp. 92–93, no. 767.
