## Condition

Mended. A fill on the rim and the shoulder.

## Description

Fire-polished rim; conical neck with large bulge at its base; elongated, conical body narrowing to a bulb-like bottom, which is flat, with a pontil scar (W. 0.5 cm).

Decorated with colorful, marvered chips of opaque glass applied on the vessel while it was still globular, which stretched while the vessel was inflated and tooled to its final dimensions.

## Comments and Comparanda

Vessels of this shape are known as “spearhead flasks” due to the tapering of the body toward the narrow bottom, which gives them a shape similar to a spearhead. They were identified as containers of kohl, a cosmetic substance for the decoration of the eyelids, which was archaeologically attested in different sites in Israel and Sinai Peninsula ([[Brosh 1993]]; [[Shindo 1993]], pp. 303–304). On spearhead flasks see comments and comparanda cited in {% cat '2003.446' %}, with various parallels dated from the seventh to the twelfth centuries.
