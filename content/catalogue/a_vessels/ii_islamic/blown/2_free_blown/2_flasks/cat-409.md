## Condition

Intact. Some weathering that has caused iridescence.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; conical neck with large bulge under the rim and a smaller one at its base; elongated, conical body, narrowing to a small flat bottom, which is flat, with a pontil scar (W. 0.5 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

Vessels of this shape are known as “spearhead flasks” due the tapering of the body toward the narrow bottom. They were recognized as containers for kohl, a cosmetic substance for the decoration of the eyelids, which was archaeologically attested in different sites in Israel and the Sinai Peninsula ([[Brosh 1993]]; [[Shindo 1993]], pp. 303–304).

Predecessors of the spearlike flasks with pointed body but smooth neck are known and have been dated between the seventh and ninth centuries ([[Goldstein et al. 2005]], p. 67, no. 55, pp. 72–73, no. 67). The spearhead flasks have been dated from the eighth to the twelfth centuries. In addition to the numerous undecorated free-blown examples (e.g., [[Auth 1976]], p. 231, nos. 534–536, esp. no. 535; [[Dzanpoladian and Kalantarian 1988]], p. 24, no. 55, plate XLIII:7; [[Arakelian, Tiratzian, and Khachatrian 1969]], p. 64, no. 148; [[von Saldern 1974]], p. 243, no. 381; [[Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001]], p. 43, forms 18a–d; [[Foy 2020]], pp. 68–69 type Sb44; [[Goldstein et al. 2005]], p. 222, no. 256; [[Whitehouse 2014]], pp. 51–53, nos. 671, 674, 676; [[Hadad 2005]], pp. 40–41, 164–165, plate 38:784–786), there are published several examples with marvered decoration ([[Lamm 1930]], plate 32:5–7; [[Harden 1955]], p. 63, no. 14, fig. 37; [[Whitecomb 1983]], p. 102, fig. 2.cc, ee, mm, nn; [[Taniichi 1987]], pp. 53, 90, no. 108; [[von Saldern 1968]], no. 69, plate 68; [[Carboni and Whitehouse 2001a]], p. 139, no. 55; [[Carboni 2001]], pp. 304–305, nos. 80a–c; [[Goldstein et al. 2005]], p. 261, nos. 300–303) and with spiraling or vertical ribbing ([[Carboni 2001]], p. 242, no. 3.29a; [[Whitehouse 2014]], pp. 105, 114, no. 805), and with mold-blown motifs ([[von Saldern 1968]], p. 94, no. 68; [[Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001]], p. 43, form 18e; [[Whitehouse 2014]], pp. 105, 107–108, nos. 788, 792).
