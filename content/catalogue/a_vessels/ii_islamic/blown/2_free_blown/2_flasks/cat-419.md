## Comments and Comparanda

Facet-cut, small-size vessels are a well-known form, reflecting the fashion that appreciated cut decoration on various forms of tableware and smaller flasks. They have been attributed to Iranian workshops, since this technique was known in sixth-century Sassanian glassware, although they may have been produced in other regions as well ([[Carboni 2001]], p. 131, no. 2.34b; [[Brosh 2003]], p. 363, no. 491). Sites yielding finds include Fustat in Egypt ([[Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001]], pp. 86–88, form 41, and especially 41c–f, which are elongated examples like 79.AF.184.15, dated in the ninth–tenth century); Sabra al-Mansuriyya, Tunisia ([[Foy 2020]], p. 98, type Sb23, fig. 42); a flask in the Israel Museum ([[Brosh 2003]], p. 363, no. 495), and two more in the Khalili Collection ([[Goldstein et al. 2005]], p. 159, nos. 185–186).
