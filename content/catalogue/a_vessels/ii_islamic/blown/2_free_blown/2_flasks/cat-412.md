## Condition

Mended. Pastiche. Neck is glued onto the body. The lower end of the neck is wider than the opening on the body, giving the impression of a slight diaphragm. Iridescence on the exterior. Incrustation on the interior .

## Description

Flat, ground rim; wide, cylindrical neck. Sloping shoulder; rectangular body, square in cross section; flat bottom. No pontil mark visible on the corroded bottom. An elongated vertical indentation mark is visible along the center and particularly on the upper part of each side, probably a mark from the tool used for the angular shaping of the body.
