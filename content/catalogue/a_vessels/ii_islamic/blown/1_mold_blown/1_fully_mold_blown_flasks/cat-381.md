## Condition

Pastiche of two fragments. Covered with weathering and incrustation. Repaired break between the neck and the body. “Fake weathering” (resin and chunks of weathered glass) present on the neck to make it look like it goes with the body. Neck belongs to a different vessel, glued to the body in modern times. The feet probably were originally longer.

## Description

Round, vertical rim; cylindrical neck; four-sided body, square in cross section; wedge-shaped feet.

Deeply cut decoration. Deep horizontal groove along the middle of the body. Triangular, oblique strokes transect the body diagonally, forming a lozenge-shape motif. Two deep, triangular bevels on each corner, pointing to the top and bottom of the vessel, leaving a prunt along the central groove. Below the horizontal groove a deep bevel at the center of each side delineates four pyramidal, wedge-shaped feet.

## Comparanda

Molar flasks, named for the wedge-shaped feet reminiscent of the shape of the roots of a human tooth, and usually decorated with deep cut motifs, are typical for the entire Islamic world of the ninth–tenth centuries, unearthed more often in Egyptian sites. They were probably produced in several regions. They were used as containers for scented oils and perfumes. Examples include finds from Egypt (Fustat: [[Shindo 1992]], p. 185, nos. 6–11; [[Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001]], pp. 95–97, figs. 42–43); the Sinai Peninsula (Raya and al-Tur: [[Kawatoko 1996]], plate 37, no. 15, plate 40:7; [[Shindo 2003]], fig. 3: 8); Palestine ([[Hadad 2005]], pp. 45 and 172–173, no. 868); Syria ([[Lane 1937]], p. 66, fig. 10:E; [[Salam-Liebich 1978]], p. 146; [[Riis 1957]], p. 53, figs. 138–145, no. 140); Iraq (Samarra: [[Lamm 1928]], pp. 215–219); Iran (Susa: [[Kervran 1984]], fig. 8, no. 26; Nishapur: [[Kröger 1995]], pp. 135–137; Siraf: [[Whitehouse 1968]], p. 19); the Arabian Peninsula ([[Zarins et Zahrani 1985]], plate 18, no. 31); the East African coast ([[Chittick 1974]], fig. 154a); southeastern Asia ([[Swan Needell 2018]], plate 6, no. 71); Tunis (Sabra al-Mansuriyya: [[Foy 2020]], p. 84, no. 123).
