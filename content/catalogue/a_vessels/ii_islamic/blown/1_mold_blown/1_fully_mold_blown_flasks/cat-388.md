## Condition

Pastiche. Repair at one foot; repaired break at neck. XRF suggests these three combined elements do not go together.

## Description

In-folded, flattened rim; conical neck with five horizontal constrictions; four-sided body, square in cross section; wedge-shaped feet.

Deeply cut decoration. Horizontal grooves on the upper and lower end of the preserved part of the neck. Deep horizontal groove along the middle of the body. On the corners, short, triangular bevels pointing downward, leaving a prunt at top and bottom of the vessel. On the lower part of the body a deep, triangular bevel at the center of each side delineates four pyramidal, wedge-shaped feet.
