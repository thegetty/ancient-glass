## Condition

Intact; a small chip missing from the bottom.

## Description

Fire-polished, rounded rim; conical neck, constricted at its base; pear-shaped body, slightly raised base-ring; flat bottom. Slightly lopsided neck. The body is covered with mold-blown honeycomb pattern of six horizontal rows of hexagonal cells. Blown on a three-part mold with two vertical parts and one for the base, with a slightly raised circle at the periphery of the bottom rendering a ring-base.

## Comparanda

Mold-blown and dip mold–blown glass vessels are present in various periods of Islamic glassware ([[Whitehouse 2001c]], pp. 81–83). Honeycomb pattern appears in Islamic glassware on jugs, juglets, bowls, and jars in the tenth–eleventh centuries (e.g., [[Brosh 2003]], pp. 356–357, nos. 479–482) and in the twelfth–thirteenth centuries (e.g., [[Whitehouse 2014]], pp. 97–102, nos. 771–782), and some of them were probably made in Iran ([[von Saldern 1974]], pp. 194, 197–199, 204, nos. 290–291, 293–294, 296, 306; [[Carboni and Whitehouse 2001]], pp. 98–99, nos. 24–25).
