## Condition

Pastiche. Repaired break present at neck. Neck is a notably different color than the body. XRF suggests neck and body do not go together. The feet were probably longer and pointed originally.

## Description

Round, vertical rim; cylindrical neck; rounded shoulder; four-sided body, square in cross section; wedge-shaped feet.

Deeply cut decoration. Deep stroke on each side of the body under the shoulder. Deep, triangular bevel on the corners of upper body. A deep bevel at the center of each side delineates four pyramidal, wedge-shaped feet.
