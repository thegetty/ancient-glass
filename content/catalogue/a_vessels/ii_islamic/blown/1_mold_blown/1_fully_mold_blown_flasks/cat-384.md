## Condition

Pastiche. Neck is probably a modern amendment. Body iridescent and partly covered by weathering and incrustation on the exterior and interior.

## Description

Ground rim; cylindrical neck, probably modern. Four-sided body, square in cross section; short, wedge-shaped feet.

Cut decoration. On the upper part of each side a continuous horizontal stroke; below this stroke, a triangular cut pointing upward. A deep bevel at the center of each side delineates four feet; feet originally pyramidal, wedge-shaped, but currently almost totally ground off.
