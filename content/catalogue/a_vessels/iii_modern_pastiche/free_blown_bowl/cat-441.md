## Condition

Intact; small patches of white weathering.

## Description

In-folded, flaring rim. The lip was in-folded for 1.4 cm and then it was flattened only in the interior leaving the exterior walls convex. The neck is extremely short and wide; the body is ovular and stands on an applied conical base. At the center of the bottom there is a circular excess of colorless glass, remainder of a solid pontil (W. 1 cm) which was used for holding the vessel during the shaping of the rim and the attachment of the handles. There are three coil handles attached on the shoulder and stretched up ending on the tip of the rim forming an almost circular loop.

## Comments and Comparanda

It may be modern. There are too many air bubbles in its mass. The shape and curvature of the handles is unexpected, although the handles are not cut, as a modern glassblower would have done, but rather the end of the coil is stretched and bent on the body of the handle as one would expect it in an ancient product. The extremely elongated fold of glass that has been folded in the interior of the rim is unprecedented among ancient vessels. The truly colorless glass of the solid pontil scar looks also modern, if it was indeed ancient this quality of glass would have been very rare and expensive and it would not be “wasted” on the tip of the pontil for the production of such an average vessel.
