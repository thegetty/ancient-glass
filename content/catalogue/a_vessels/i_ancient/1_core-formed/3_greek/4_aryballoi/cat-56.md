## Condition

Fully preserved. The vessel has much discoloration, visible especially around the mouth and neck. There are a few minor abrasions, such as nicks and scratches.

## Description

Core-formed, dark blue aryballos with a ribbed body decorated with white and yellow combed pattern. Inward-sloping rim-disk with tooling marks above. Cylindrical neck. Right-angled junction with rounded shoulder. Ribbed, spherical-ovoid body. Convex bottom. Two blue scroll-shaped handles extend from under the mouth to the shoulder.

An unmarvered yellow thread is wound around the rim. Thread continues (probably the same one), marvered, spiraling twice around the neck and twice around the shoulder, then continuing, spiraling seven more times on the central body, alternating with a white thread in a combed pattern. Around the bottom a white thread is wound two times and a yellow once. A finer, white thread appearing near the bottom is the loose end of the thread wound around the body.
