## Condition

Intact.

## Description

Dark green, seemingly black ground, opaque white decoration. Horizontal disk-shaped rim; short, wide, cylindrical neck, tapering downward; rudimentary shoulder; straight-sided conical body; convex bottom. Two opposing lugs on shoulders. One is made by folding and flattening a dark green band four times and the other twice.

An opaque white thread wound spirally 44 times from bottom to the rim and dragged eight times upward and downward along the body, forming a feather pattern.

## Comments and Comparanda

For a discussion of early core-formed alabastra, see {% cat '2003.180' %}. This object belongs to the third group of core-formed vessels, which appears between the second century BCE and the early first century CE; the centers of production seem to have been in Cyprus and on the Phoenician coast. It includes different shapes of alabastra and amphoriskoi, which are similar to those of ceramic vessels manufactured at the same time ([[Harden 1981]], pp. 123–141; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 122–125). For the classification of this particular alabastron compare [[Grose 1989]], class III:E, alabastron form III:4: p. 168, no. 165, which has a much more acute angle turning to the bottom. Cf. [[Fossing 1940]], p. 112, fig. 84, spotted by Axel von Saldern ([[von Saldern 1974]], no. 191), who also notes that this vessel (2003.194) does not have the unusually elongated shape, but is greatly expanded below the middle of the body.
