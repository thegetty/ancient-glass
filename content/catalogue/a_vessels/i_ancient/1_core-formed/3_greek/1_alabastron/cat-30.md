Flaring, fire-polished rim; elongated conical body; convex bottom. The interior is smooth, covered in areas by a layer of whitish incrustation.

## Comments and Comparanda

On core-formed alabastra of this period see comments on {% cat '2003.194' %}. The alabastron probably belongs to the fashion of archaicizing vases that were imitating archaic prototypes. In this case for the prototype of the shape of the body see a clay alabastron from Kamiros, dated between the 610–550 BCE, kept in the British Museum: <https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1860-0404-49>. The production technique indicates a much later date, and the object is made of the exact same glass as the jug {% cat '2003.476' %} and the patella {% cat '2003.234' %}. See also comments of Axel von Saldern corroborating this dating and ascribing it to the early imperial colored glass vessels ([[von Saldern et al. 1974]], p. 112, no. 300).
