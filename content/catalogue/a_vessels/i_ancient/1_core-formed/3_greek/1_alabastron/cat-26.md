## Condition

Fully preserved. Chips are missing from the rim. Weathering has caused some iridescence. In the interior red, grainy core remains are visible.

## Description

Broad, horizontal, rim-disk; short conical neck, tapering downward; narrow but horizontal shoulder; cylindrical body, wider toward the bottom, curves in, forming a convex bottom. Below the shoulder there are two opposingly placed, small ring handles. In addition, one of the lugs forms a horizontal loop and the other a vertical one.

Decorated with yellow threads, with an unmarvered one wound around the rim. A marvered yellow thread is wound spirally 13 times from shoulder to bottom. It begins as a wavy horizontal line and then it is dragged upward at seven points, forming a festoon pattern on the body to the convex lower part, where it is again left in the form of horizontal lines.
