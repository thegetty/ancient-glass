## Condition

Almost fully preserved; small part of the rim is filled. Almost the entire vessel is covered with whitish weathering. Reddish remains of the core in the interior.

## Description

Translucent dark blue body, opaque yellow and turquoise decoration. Broad, inward-sloping rim-disk; relatively tall, cylindrical neck; almost right-angled shoulder; top-shaped body; convex bottom; circular base-knob with a rounded edge. Two dark blue vertical strap handles extend from the shoulders to the upper part of the neck under the rim.

An unmarvered opaque yellow thread is wound around the rim. A marvered wide yellow thread starts on the shoulder and spirals four times around the shoulders and the upper body, where an opaque whitish thread (its white color, likely the result of weathering, was originally turquoise) is wound twice and they are both dragged up and down, forming a zigzag pattern. Below this, a yellow marvered thread is wound horizontally twice around the body.

A bronze chain ending with a large ring is attached to one of the handles.
