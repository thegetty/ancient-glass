Intact. Condition is good, with a few abrasions, and there are some small areas of discoloration and iridescence.

## Description

Dark blue ground with opaque yellow and turquoise décor. Trefoil rim-disc; cylindrical neck; convex shoulder; straight-sided cylindrical body tapering toward the bottom; low circular pad-base, asymmetrical, uneven, and slightly concave on its underside. A dark blue strap handle extends from shoulder to beneath the rim.

An unmarvered turquoise thread is wound around the rim and spirally wound three times along the neck. On the body, a marvered turquoise and one white thread spirally wound five times and dragged downward, forming a festoon pattern. Around the base is wound an unmarvered turquoise thread.
