## Condition

Single body fragment. On the interior side a thick, reddish-yellow layer is preserved from remains of the core.

Translucent dark blue ground; opaque turquoise and white decoration. Fragment of the body of a seemingly cylindrical vessel.One opaque yellow and one white thread, both marvered, are spirally wound around the upper body and dragged upward, forming a zigzag pattern.

## Comments and Comparanda

Different forms of ceramic vessels were rendered in glass with core-forming from the sixth century BCE, when this technique, known in Mesopotamia and Egypt since the middle of the second millennium BCE, was introduced in the Aegean world. Amphoriskoi (small amphorae), alabastra, aryballoi, and oinochoiskai (juglets) were imitated in core-formed glass, although the original shape of the core-formed vessel that this fragment comes from has not been identified. It is believed that these vessels functioned as unguentaria, intended for aromatic and cosmetic substances ({% cite 'Harden 1981' %}; {% cite 'McClellan 1984' %}; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 109–125; {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 37–44). The earlier examples, dating from the middle of the sixth to the end of the fifth century BCE ({% cite 'Harden 1981' %}, pp. 58–99; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 110–115), were made either of blue glass and decorated with white, yellow, and turquoise threads or of milky white glass decorated with purple threads. Vessels of this group have been found in great numbers in Rhodes, Macedonia, the Aegean islands, and Italy.
