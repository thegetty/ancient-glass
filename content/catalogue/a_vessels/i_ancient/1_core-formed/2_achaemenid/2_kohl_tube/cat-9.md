## Condition

Top of body and rim restored.

## Description

Cylindrical body, tapering toward the rim; flat, lopsided bottom.

An unmarvered thread of the same color as the body is spirally wound around the body from shoulder to bottom and dragged upward and downward nine times to form a feather pattern. The ends of the thread are visible, and overall the decoration may have been made by scoring/pressing the still-hot surface with a sharp tool, creating the impression of an applied thread.
