## Condition

Mended, fills in several parts of the body.

## Description

Dark blue ground; opaque white, yellow, and turquoise décor. Flattened, horizontal rim with rounded edge; wide, cylindrical neck, slightly tapering toward the body; almost horizontal rounded shoulder; squat, bulbous body; tall, conical footed base with rounded edge. On the upper body, right below the shoulder, three dark blue loop handles are arranged at equal distances.

A marvered turquoise thread is wound around the rim. Around the neck and on the lower part of the body three marvered threads—opaque white, yellow, and turquoise—are spirally wound and dragged upward, forming a festooned pattern. A marvered turquoise thread encircles the base.

## Comments and Comparanda

Krateriskoi are one of the most characteristic Egyptian vessel forms. This particular shape and the presence of handles date it to the reigns of Tuthmosis IV, when handles were added to krateriskoi, and Amenhotep III, when they were most popular and perfectly shaped, ca. 1397–1350 BCE ({% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 130–131). Furthermore, the turquoise thread around the rim ascribes it to a particular workshop that specialized in decoration of festoon patterns, among which this feature exclusively appears ({% cite 'Nolte 1968' %}, workshop 2a, plate VII:12; {% cite 'Nolte 1985' %}, p. 95, plate 7.9, 12).
