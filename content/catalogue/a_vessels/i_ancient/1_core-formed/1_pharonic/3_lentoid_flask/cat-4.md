## Condition

Mended; parts of the thread on the rim are missing. Reddish remains of the core in the interior.

## Description

Dark blue ground, opaque yellow and green decoration. A flattened coil forms a rudimentary uneven rim-disk; cylindrical neck, tapering toward the body; lentoid body. Two green loop handles extend from lower neck to the shoulder.

An unmarvered yellow thread is wound around the rim. One yellow and one green marvered threads are spirally wound 4 times around the body and dragged up and down 12 times to form a loosely rendered feathered pattern.

## Comments and Comparanda

The translucent, bright copper-blue base color is typical of the Ramesside period (Nineteenth–Twentieth Dynasties; 1292–1070), as is the large green and yellow feather decor of the body. Numerous fragments from the glass workshop in Lisht of thick-walled, squat vessels confirm the dating ([[Nolte 1968]], workshop 5, pp. 121–126, form VII, pp. 172–173, wherein several parallels are cited). The vessel is one of the last thread-decorated glasses in Egypt of excellent quality. Cf. [[Nolte 1968]], p. 121, plate XXI:11, similar feather decoration in yellow and white; XXI:22, a small vessel of a similar shape with yellow and green thread decoration and greenish handles. Also cf. MMA turquoise body, blue, white, and yellow threads 30.8.179 \[ca. 1295–1070 BCE\]: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/569296.
