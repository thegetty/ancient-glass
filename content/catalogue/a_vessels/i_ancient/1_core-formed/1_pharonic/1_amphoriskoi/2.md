## Condition

Mended, heavily reconstructed and filled. Discolorized from weathering. 

## Description

Short cylindrical neck, ovular body convex bottom. Two opposingly placed milky yellow vertical loop handles are modern restoration. 

A turquoise or translucent gray unmarvered thread around the rim. The dark-colored body is decorated with splashes of turquoise and yellow glass.

## Comparanda and Comments

No direct parallels are published. The vessel could be a flask ({Nolte 1968,} form 1), although it cannot be excluded that it originally had handles ({Nolte 1968,} form II). Probably connected to the production of a workshop active after the Amarna period in an unknown place, during the Ramesside period (nineteenth-twentieth dynasties I.e. thirteenth-eleventh century B.C.) where single-colored vessels were made alongside thread-decorated vases of workgroup 5. ({Nolte 1968,} p. 127-129, Workshop 6).

## Provenance

- **By 1968 – 1988**, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901 – 1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988.
- **1988 – 2003**, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003.
