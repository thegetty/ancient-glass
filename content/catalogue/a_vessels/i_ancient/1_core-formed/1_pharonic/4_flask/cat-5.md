## Condition

Partly preserved; restored; many cracks are clearly visible, and there are some areas of fill. The surface has some nicks and scratches.

## Description

Ground dark blue, and white in the area of the belly, with yellow thread decoration. Fish-shaped container.

An unmarvered yellow thread is wound around the open mouth and another is applied along the top of the back. The eyes are outlined with a yellow thread. There are two small white projections on the underside, indicating fish’s ventral fins. A flush, vertical yellow thread divides the head from the body and a parallel thread is preserved at the middle of the body; a third yellow thread forms large zigzags between them. On the upper part of the body there are small cavities, which are filled with a translucent yellow substance, possibly glass.

## Comments and Comparanda

The vessel belongs to a well-known form of fish-shaped flasks that represent a *Tilapia nilotica* fish, common in the Nile and a standard decorative motif in ancient Egyptian art rendered in many media ({% cite 'Shaw and Nicholson 1995' %}, p. 100). These flasks seem to have held ointments, and since they cannot stand by themselves, they must have been supported by stands. Published examples have been unearthed in Malkata and Amarna (cf. {% cite 'Nolte 1968' %}, pp. 70, 134–136, 176, form XI, plates XXVIII:59, 60; XXIX:1, 2). Other fish-shaped, core-formed Egyptian vessels are known from museum collections: a very colorful example in the British Museum EA55193: <https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA55193> ({% cite 'Nolte 1968' %}, p. 70, plate XXIX:2; {% cite 'Cooney 1976' %}, p. 146, no. 1753, plate VII) and a monochrome one, EA63786: <https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA63786> ({% cite 'Cooney 1976' %}, p. 146, no. 1754; {% cite 'Tait 1991' %}, p. 28, fig. 23); a single-colored fish in the Brooklyn Museum, 37.316E (<https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/4014>); also, a similar fish-shaped glass object, probably used as a palette, of the same period is in Miho Museum ({% cite 'Miho Museum 2001' %}, p. 29, 192, no. 21).
