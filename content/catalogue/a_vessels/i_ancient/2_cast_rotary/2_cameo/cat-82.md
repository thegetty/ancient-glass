## Condition

Stem and base missing; body reassembled from fragments; chips missing from the broken edges, from the ends of the handle flanges, and from various parts of the figural scene.

## Description

Two-handled cup (skyphos), formerly on stem and foot. Rim rounded in the interior, wheel-cut groove below the rim in the interior and another on the exterior; body with slightly convex sides that taper toward the flat, faintly convex bottom. Wheel-cut stem, broken just below bottom of cup. Two vertical circular handles, attached to rim, and to body at its maximum diameter, with horizontal finger-rests, a nick partway down the outside of the curve, and long, downward-curving thumb rests.

A continuous thick, straight groundline on the lower part just above the transition to the bottom and the wheel-cut groove below the lip delineate the space on both sides of the vessel on which two religious scenes rendered in white cameo are evolving. These scenes illustrate the participation of Ariadne in rituals of the Dionysiac cult, and perhaps of Cybele. The scenes are separated by the two handles. Below each handle is a mask of a Silenus.

Side A: On the left side is a tree with broad leaves, probably a fig tree, of which two branches—one divides in its upper part into two—extend up and behind a naked satyr, who is moving in three-quarter profile to left, looking in profile to right. The satyr is holding in his right hand a pan-pipe (syrinx), and in his left hand, resting against his forearm, a Bacchic crooked staff (pedum). At the center of this side, seated on a seven-layered rocky outcrop, is a female figure, identified as Ariadne, the Cretan princess who was abandoned by Theseus on the island of Naxos; Dionysos discovered here there and married her. She is shown in three-quarter profile to left, head in profile to right, her right arm thrown over her head and touching her forehead, her left arm vertical, with her hand flat on the rock on which she sits, torso naked, lower limbs covered with a drape which is also drawn up over her right arm. Behind her is a female figure, a maidservant standing in profile to left, head garlanded, torso naked, lower limbs draped; her arms are extended to offer to Ariadne a rectangular or circular object covered with layers of cloth, identified as a sacred basket (liknon), perhaps depicting the revelation of the Bacchic cult mysteries. On the right side, a tree with tightly narrow leaves growing vertically upward, probably a nut tree, closes the scene.

Side B: On the left side is a tree with broad leaves, probably a fig tree, and two branches, one of which—divided in its upper part into two—extends up and above a female figure, identified as Ariadne, in profile to right, her right arm raised with phiale, a large hemispherical bowl to her mouth, her left arm extended downward, with hand resting on the rim of a krater, torso naked, lower limbs draped. At the center of the side a naked male satyr stands in three-quarter profile to right, garlanded head turning back in profile to left, arms raised to hold and play the lyre he holds in front of him, legs apart, with weight resting on his left foot and the toes of his right foot on the groundline. Next is a pillar surmounted by a figure seated on a throne, with a phiale in its right hand and a tympanum in left, identified with the goddess Cybele; the pillar is crossed by branches of tree, implying a rustic shrine—as do the trees that frame the entire scene. In front of the tree and pillar is a male figure in three-quarter profile to left, identified as Dionysos, perhaps seated on layered rock, his right arm extended, seemingly putting an almond-shaped pinch of incense onto the flaming altar in front of the pillar and next to him, his left arm bent, a pyxis with incense in his left hand, lower limbs draped; nut tree or possibly laurel with tightly bunched leaves growing vertically, and with trunk and branches, grows up behind the seated figure and in front of the column.

## Comments and Comparanda

Glass cameo objects comprise one of the most opulent groups of Roman glassware, which are imitating multilayered and multicolored natural stone such as agate and onyx. They are made by casting, probably in a mold, one or more layers of bright, opaque glass over a dark translucent ground, which in some cases was then free-blown (e.g., 85.AF.84). (For a multicolored fragment of a crater see {% cite 'Roberts et al. 2010' %}, p. 50, no. 10.) The most popular color combination is translucent dark blue body with opaque white overlay. Translucent dark purple (e.g., {% cat '96.AF.289' %}), green, and brown were occasionally also used for the underlying layer, while very rarely opaque red, opaque green, light blue, translucent purple, and brown were used for the overlying layers. The figures on the outer layer were generated in intaglio on the inside of the plaster mold or parts of it were removed, creating bright low-relief decoration on a dark background. The cameo technique was used for the production of sumptuous tableware, such as drinking and serving vessels, as well as flasks, inlays, medallions, and gems. This was a short-lived fashion that lasted from the late first century BCE to the early first century CE, and the production is likely placed in Italy, probably in Rome. Technically different cameos meet a revival in the fourth century CE ({% cite 'Whitehouse 1991' %}, pp. 19–32; {% cite 'Lierke 2009' %}, pp. 62–72).
