## Condition

Single fragment.

## Description

On the front side of the preserved fragment a male head can be seen. The head is in profile turned to the right; he is clean-shaven and wearing a laurel wreath, the upper part of the head covered with short, slightly curved locks of a Julio-Claudian style. Back side is flat, with some hardly noticeable undulation.

## Comments and Comparanda

The fragment is flat and the back side shows no indication of a curve, merely some hardly noticeable undulation. If indeed from a vessel, it must had been a large or wide vessel. Compared to the majority of the cameo vessels or gems this fragment is very thin (0.30–0.20 cm). Cameo vessels are usually thicker (compare {% cat '84.AF.85' %} [Th. 0.7 cm]), although thinner (0.3–0.5 cm) vessels do appear occasionally (e.g., {% cite 'Whitehouse 1997a' %}, pp. 58–62, nos. 60–68). If not from a vessel it could be part of a cameo gem or medallion, although these are also thicker (e.g., {% cite 'Whitehouse 1997a' %}, pp. 42–43, nos. 37–38, medallions 1.1 and 0.9 cm thick, respectively; {% cite 'Roberts et al. 2010' %}, p. 72, no. 62, 0.6 cm). For another cameo glass gem in the Getty Museum see {% cite 'Spier 1992' %}, p. 158, no. 436, ac. no. 81.AN.172.
