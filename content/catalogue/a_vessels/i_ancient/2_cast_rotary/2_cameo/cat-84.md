## Condition

Rim is missing; small areas show weathering.

## Description

Flaring rim, lip not preserved; fine cylindrical neck widening toward ovular body; flat, mildly convex bottom.

On the body, the following scene from left to right: A naked boy with a garland in his hands is approaching an altar surmounted by a seated figure of the god Thoth as a baboon wearing moon disc; on the base of the altar is a figure of a crouching ibis (another animal associated with the god Thoth) with a moon disc over its head. Another naked boy with flying cloak holds up a curved object, possibly a torch, before a horned altar with a flame on it. On the base of the altar is carved a uraeus—a rearing cobra and sun disc—a symbol of royalty and divine authority in Egypt. In front of the right side of the altar is a standing figure of a pharaoh wearing a striped nemes headdress and the Double Crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, and a pleated kilt. He is holding a rnpt sign (notched palm branch) in the right hand—a symbol of time and in this context regnal years, i.e., a long reign promised by the gods—and nw-pot in the left—a type of vessel used by Egyptians for religious offerings-. Behind him stand an obelisk with indecipherable hieroglyphs (from top to bottom on the shaft: circle enclosing a dot \[Ra symbol\]; scarab with spread wings; an eye with its brow; a snake; a spindle-like object; an angle; a falcon. On the base in a horizontal band: two sloping lines; a circle; three vertical lines; walking legs), and a twisted tree with two leafy branches. On the mildly convex bottom is a five-petaled rosette surrounded by eight triangular, serrated sepals that extend to the straight line that forms the groundline of the figural composition that is extending around the body.

## Comments and Comparanda

The Egyptian-looking decoration is not unique among cameo glass objects ([[Roberts et al. 2010]], pp. 54–55, nos. 20–23, 64; [[van Aerde 2013]]), and belongs to a well-known genre of artistic scenes depicted in that period, with which the Italian clientele apparently was well-acquainted and wished to acquire. It has been plausibly proposed that the elements that comprise this puzzling scene—a pharaoh, an obelisk, and a statue of the god Thoth as a baboon—are not depicting a particular scene, but rather serve as decorative Egyptian images understandable by Romans of the Augustan era, when Egyptian art objects, like statues and even obelisks, were brought to and displayed around Rome ([[Bianchi and Fazzini 1988]], pp. 218–219; [[Wight and Swetnam-Burland 2010]]; [[Cole 2018]]).

In terms of its shape, the flask belongs to the usually colorful free-blown flasks of Isings form 6 ([[Isings 1957]], p. 22), which is dated from the very early first century CE. A very close parallel is known from Canton Ticino, Switzerland, dated to the period 10–30 CE ([[Biaggio-Simona 1991]], vol. 1, p. 337, and vol. 2, no. 16.2.029). It is also close to De Tommaso’s type 5 ([[De Tommaso 1990]], pp. 39–40), dated to the Julio-Claudian period. Furthermore, a fragment of a similarly shaped cameo flask is in the Corning Museum of Glass ([[Whitehouse 1997a]], p. 56, no. 57).
