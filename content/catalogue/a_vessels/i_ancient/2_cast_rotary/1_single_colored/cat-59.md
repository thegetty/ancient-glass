## Description

Thick conical/mastoid bowl with rounded rim and convex bottom. In the interior, 0.7 cm below the rim, three horizontal grooves, each 0.3 cm wide.

## Comments and Comparanda

Conical and hemispherical grooved bowls are the most characteristic glass vessels made on the Syro-Palestinian coast in the second half of the second to the middle of the first century BCE. This form appears to have been widespread throughout the Mediterranean from the Levant to the Atlantic coast. They were imitating silver bowls. On this form see [[Grose 1979]], pp. 54–59, group A; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 193–194, 204–207, nos. 211–222. Further parallels and discussions on the form include [[Weinberg 1970]], p. 21, nos. 1–11; [[Weinberg 1973]], nos. 1–8; [[Hayes 1975]], p. 18, no. 39; [[Auth 1976]], p. 45, no. 33; [[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 284–285, no. 79; [[Nenna 1999a]], pp. 70, 72, no. c32; [[Israeli 2003]], p. 77, no. 63; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 67, no. 16.
