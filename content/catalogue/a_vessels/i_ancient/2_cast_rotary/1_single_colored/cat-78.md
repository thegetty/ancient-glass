## Description

Flaring, horizontal rim with rounded edge; hemispherical body with convex walls; convex bottom; conical base-ring with flat edge.

## Comments and Comparanda

This hemispherical bowl belongs to a relatively rare type of Early Roman cast vessel, mainly carinated plates and bowls and rectangular trays, executed in striking colors of single-colored and mosaic opaque glass in the first half of the first century CE ([[Isings 1957]], p. 36, form 20; [[Grose 1991]], pp. 256, 314, 306–307, nos. 415, 422, 426). Parallels from controlled excavations include finds from Herculaneum and Pompeii dated to the Augustan–Tiberian period ([[Scatozza Höricht 1986]], pp. 32–33, plate XIII, form 7; [[Beretta and Pasquale 2004]], p. 21, no. 1.32); Taranto, from a context dated between the second and the third quarter of the first century CE ([[Maraschini 1988]], p. 598, no. 41.9f, plate M); Vindonissa, dated to the Tiberian or Tiberian–early Claudian period ([[Burger 1960]], p. 28, no. 43, plates 17, 24); Cologne, dated to the first century CE ([[Fremersdorf 1958]], p. 37, plate 50; [[La Baume 1973]], plate 48, 2 K 5); Trier, dated to ca. the middle of the first century CE ([[Goethert-Polaschek 1977]], p. 34 n. 88, plate 33, p. 349, form 18).
