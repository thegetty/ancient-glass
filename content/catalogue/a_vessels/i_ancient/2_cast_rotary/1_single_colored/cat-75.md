## Comments and Comparanda

Cast, angular vessels are a very characteristic shape for the early Roman period class of glass finewares. Among them carinated, cast bowls are a quite widespread early Roman vessel shape, made of single-colored (2003.232, {% cat '2003.233' %}, {% cat '2003.234' %}) and mosaic opaque glass ({% cat '2003.248' %}–{% cat '2003.250' %}) in striking colors; slightly later, they appear in translucent glass ([[Isings 1957]], form 2). They were probably produced in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean as well. The earlier examples have the constriction near the middle of the body, and the later near the rim, like the examples in the JPGM collection, indicating that they were probably produced in the second quarter of the century ([[Stern 1979]], pp. 63–72, plate 6; [[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 65, 328–331, nos. 99–101). Finds include bowls from Meroë, Sudan, dated ca. 20 BCE ([[Stern 1981]], pp. 38, 55–56, nos. 17, 18, 18a, figs. 17, 18); Tanis, Nile Delta ([[Cooney 1976]], p. 43, 376, not ill.); Syria ([[Ritz 1931]], plate 6.2, no. O.37554); near Istanbul ([[La Baume 1973]], no. C 6.4); Vindonissa, Swiss, ([[Berger 1960]], p. 28, no. 41, plate 17, no. 22); Magdalensberg, Austria dated before CE 45 ([[Czurda-Ruth 1979]], p. 71, plate 3, nos. 535–537); Haltern, Germany dated before CE 9 ([[Kropatscheck 1909]], p. 371. fig. 16, no. 3; [[van Lith 1977]], p. 13, note 61). Further examples are kept in several museums in Israel ([[Israeli 2003]], pp. 84–85, nos. 79–80), USA ([[Grose 1989]], p. 256, nos. 419–422; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 83, no. 70), Canada ([[Hayes 1975]], p. 21, no. 55) and Japan ([[Miho Museum 2001]], p. 70, no. 78).
