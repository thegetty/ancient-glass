## Condition

Intact; on most of the interior and on small parts of the exterior, cream and iridescent areas of weathering.

## Description

Slightly everted, almost vertical, smooth, fire-rounded rim; deep body decorated with 31 vertical, short ribs; flat, slightly concave bottom. At the exterior, the band below the rim was flattened with a blunt tool detectable on the upper end of the ribs. The ribs are slightly oblique, slanting from right to left at the bottom; unequal in size, ranging from 2.2 to 3; and unevenly spaced. In three cases the rib was not formed and in its place is only visible a small protuberance. In the interior two horizontal grooves 0.2 cm wide are incised at 0.8 ad 1.6 cm below the rim.
