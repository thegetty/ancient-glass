## Condition

Fully preserved; small part of body is missing. Interior covered with whitish weathering.

## Description

Flaring, almost horizontal rim; short, cylindrical neck; narrow, sloping shoulder; biconical carinated body; flat bottom.

Two parallel horizontal grooves at the transition from the shoulder to the upper end of the body, one on the greatest diameter of the body, and two more at the transition to the bottom. Gold-band mosaic formed from five bands, in the following order: blue outlined in white; purple; colorless, encasing shattered golden leaf outlined in white, turquoise, and green. These lengths of canes have been bent, forming a U-shaped motif. This pattern is repeated three times on the body.
