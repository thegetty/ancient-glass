## Condition

Partly preserved. The surface bears iridescent patches and pitting. The entire neck, excluding a small fragment on the rim, is a restoration.

## Description

Cylindrical neck; pear-shaped body; flattened base. The restoration has added to the end of the preserved cylindrical neck an outward-splayed mouth and a lip folded inward.

The vessel is made of blue and purple rods flanked and partly lined by white layers. making some of the purple appear as lavender and most of the blue as turquoise. In total there seem to be 20–21 rods of glass, interchanging wide purple and turquoise, flanked by thin white ones, which were fused side by side and then slumped to assume the pear shape of the body.
