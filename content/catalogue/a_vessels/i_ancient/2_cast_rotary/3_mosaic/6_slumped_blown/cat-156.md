## Condition

Mended; neck is restored.

## Description

Folded in and flattened flaring rim; cylindrical neck, constricted at its base; elongated tear-drop body; flat bottom. Probably four lengths of composite mosaic canes comprising spirals of fine opaque white and a thick, translucent dark blue layer, fused into a mass that was consequently blown to its final shape and size.

## Comments and Comparanda

On slumped and blown vessels, see comments on {% cat '2003.277' %}. Slumped and blown examples are quite rare (cf. {% cite 'Oliver 1980' %}, p. 49, nos. 30–31; {% cite 'Loudmer and Kevorkian 1985' %}, pp. 43, 52, nos. 94, 108–109) as opposed to free-blown, tear-shaped unguentaria, which are one of the most widespread and numerous groups of early Roman blown unguentaria. They appear from the beginning of the first century CE, their distribution culminates around the middle of it, and they cease to circulate in the early second century CE ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 24, form 8; {% cite 'Rütti 1991a' %}, pp. 114–116, forms ΑR 128.1, 129, 130; {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, pp. 149–150, form 126b, wherein many examples are cited; {% cite 'Fünfschilling 2015' %}, p. 402, form AR 128).
