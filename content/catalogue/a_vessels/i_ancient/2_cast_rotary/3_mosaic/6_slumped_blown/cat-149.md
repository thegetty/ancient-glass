## Condition

Mended. Exterior covered with whitish iridescent weathering; interior covered with weathering and soil crust.

## Description

Flaring, flattened rim; cylindrical neck, tapering toward the bulbous body; flat bottom. The vessel consists of ca. 18 amber-color and white rods which were fused together, slumped, and blown to form the closed shape of the vessel and then “combed” 11 times, forming a distinct zigzag pattern. Rotary marks are visible in the interior of the neck.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the production technique see comments on {% cat '2003.277' %}.

This type of squat flask is well-known and has been unearthed in different parts of the Roman Empire, mainly in the western areas and Italy, which is considered to be their production site ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 22–23, form 6; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 261–262, 339–340, no. 609). The decoration of these glass vessels was imitating vessels carved from semiprecious stone, especially sardonyx. Published examples include finds from Aquileia ([[Calvi 1968]], plate 5, no.1, 2, 3), Athens ([[Alexandri 1972]], pp. 115–118, plate 76), Zadar ([[Ravagnan 1994]], p. 67, no. 105); Bahrain ([[Nenna 1999b]], p. 188, no. 280). In addition, several examples are in museum collections: the Louvre ([[Arveilleur-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], pp. 74–75, nos. 91, 94–95, 97, probably from Italy); National Museum of Scotland ([[Lightfoot 2007]], p. 48, nos. 46–47); Fitzwilliam Museum ([[Fitzwilliam 1978]], p. 25, no. 38); Miho Museum ([[Miho Museum 2001]], pp. 95, 203, no. 127); previously in the Winfield Smith Collection ([[[Glass from the Ancient World]{.underline} 1957]], p. 89, no. 149). The same shape has been rendered in gold-band mosaic glass as well (see [[Oliver 1967]], p. 23, no. 3, fig. 17; [[Kunina 1997]], p. 268, no. 95), and in a mosaic pattern that may be an example of blown mosaic vessels ([[[Glass from the Ancient World]{.underline} 1957]], p. 85, no. 141).
