## Condition

Mended. The surface of the glass is iridescent and pitted, and shows signs of flaking.

## Description

Rim mildly flaring; pinched and flattened cylindrical neck with a constriction at its base, squat, bulbous body with a flattened bottom.

The vessel appears to consist of ca. 20 rods fused together, which repeat the following pattern at least seven times: a wide blue rod is flanked by fine white rods. The rods were slumped to form the closed shape of the vessel and tooled at least four times on each side, forming a distinct zigzag pattern on both sides of it.
