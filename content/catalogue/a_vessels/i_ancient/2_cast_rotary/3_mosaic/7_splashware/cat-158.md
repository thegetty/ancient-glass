## Condition

Surface is weathered, with small iridescent patches. This bowl was reassembled, with large fills near the rim.

## Description

Hemispherical bowl. Splashing appears only on some parts of its interior, mainly on upper body near the rim, and consists mainly of white specks and just a few red ones. On the exterior are tooling marks: Two pairs of larger indentations and several, probably six, hardly visible, short, slanting indentations around the rim.

## Comments and Comparanda

Splashware came into fashion in the early first century CE, in the 30s, met its peak around 50s, and went out of fashion around 70 ([[Berger 1960]], p. 34; [[Biaggio-Simona 1991]], vol. 1, p. 238). The decoration was achieved by rolling or marvering a glass bubble or \[\[paraison\]\] on a flat surface, such as a marver, where chips of colored glass are arranged. The chips could have been left in relief, which was a relatively rare occurrence, as opposed to the much more numerous/usual method in which the paraison was reheated and the chips were melt flush with the surface before further expansion (see amphoriskos [2003.291](#num)) ([[Fremersdorf 1938]], pp. 116–121, summarized in English in [[Harden et al. 1987]], pp. 101–103, and [[Whitehouse 1997a]], pp. 207–212). The majority of the provenanced finds were unearthed in Italy and the western Roman provinces, where the production site may be located.

The fact that the vessel is so thick and uneven makes it quite plausible that it was slumped and thus predates the period splashware was in fashion, used on free- and mold-blown vessels, like [2003.291](#num) and [2003.315](#num), respectively.
