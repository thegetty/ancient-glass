## Condition

Single rim and upper body fragment.

## Description

The bowl has a slightly flaring lip, divided by a horizontal depression from the conical, probably cyma recta body. The preserved part of the vessel is made of discoid mosaic tesserae, with florets of two types: (1) dark blue star with eight legs set in milky white, which is set in dark blue ground; (2) amorphous chips of opaque red glass that seem to loosely surround the tesserae with the star in them.
