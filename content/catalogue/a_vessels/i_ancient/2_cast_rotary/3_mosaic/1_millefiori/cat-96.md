## Condition

Single body fragment.

## Description

Rectangular piece of a mildly curved part of a vessel, probably the transition from the bottom to the body, as the reducing thickness toward the curved part indicates. It consists of two types of rectangular tesserae: (A) green eight-petaled rosette outlined in yellow set in red; (B) blue eight-petaled rosette outlined in white set in blue. On the back side irregularly arranged the same two types of tesserae.
