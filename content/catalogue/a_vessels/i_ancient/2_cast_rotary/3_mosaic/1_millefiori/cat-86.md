## Condition

Mended with a small filling. There is some weathering on the surface.

## Description

The dish has a flared, horizontal rim; conical, carinated body; flat bottom. It stands on a circular ring-base, formed by an applied grayish green coil of glass.

The vessel is made of discoid mosaic tesserae of two types:

The first is roughly hexagonal: around a hexagonal central rod, 18 trapezoidal canes coil, forming a spiral with one and a half revolutions. Each is made of a translucent bluish core surrounded by a very fine yellow layer. The cane is surrounded by a thick purple and a fine white layer.

The second floret consists of six round concentric rods, in turn white, purple, yellow, purple, white, and purple. The white and yellow layers are considerably thinner than the purple ones. A few of these florets were probably accidentally placed on their side, appearing at a first glance purple with white striations.

## Comments and Comparanda

Mosaic vessels, although known from the Hellenistic era (fourth–first centuries BCE), become more numerous in the Early Roman period. The technique of mosaic glass provided the opportunity to create multiples of a figural or design composition by bundling and pressing colored glass canes while hot and malleable, forming the desired motif. They are made through a complex technique in which, first, rods of colored glass were tooled and fused together so that the cross section of the new composite rod would provide the desired colorful design, often a floral motif or a spiral. Next, the preformed, composite rods, called canes, were cut into disks or slices, called florets. In order to form a vessel with this motif on it, the glassmaker then arranged the florets in a desired pattern in the bottom of a two-part mold or on a flat surface that was later slumped on a convex former-mold. When heated, the florets fused together to form the vessel. Finally, the rough vessel was released from the mold and the surface was ground to a considerable depth in order to make it smooth and even. The making of a mosaic glass vessel could take a great amount of time, involving great expertise and labor as well as large quantities of fuel and raw materials (for the production technique see {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 65–66, 68–71; {% cite 'Dawes 2002' %}).

Shallow, carinated dishes—a well-known form among this group of exquisite vessels—constitute, with carinated bowls (see comments on {% cat '78.AF.32' %}), one of the most numerous groups of Composite Mosaic Vessels ({% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 257–258). This form of dish appears also among contemporaneous luxurious, monochrome glass products (see {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 254–256, figs. 136, 142; {% cite 'Goldstein 1979' %}, p. 149, no. 315). Mosaic dishes of this shape are in the collections of a number of museums, including the Toledo Museum of Art ({% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, no. 442); the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore ({% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, fig. 145; <https://art.thewalters.org/detail/13501/mosaic-plate/>); Yale University Art Gallery ({% cite 'Matheson 1980' %}, p. 20, no. 54); The Metropolitan Museum of Art ({% cite '*Glass from the Ancient World* 1957' %}, p. 82, no. 134, fig. 134; {% cite 'Milleker 2000' %}, pp. 64, 206–7, no. 51); the Corning Museum of Glass ({% cite 'Goldstein 1979' %}, pp. 180–181, no. 468, plate 25); the Louvre ({% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2000' %}, p. 148, no. 185); and Landesmuseum Württemberg Stuttgart ({% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, p. 332, no. 102).
