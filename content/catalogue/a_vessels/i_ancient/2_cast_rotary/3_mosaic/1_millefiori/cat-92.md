## Condition

Fully preserved; mended and filled.

## Description

The bowl has a flaring lip, conical, cyma recta body, and flat bottom; stands on a splayed, circular ring-base, formed by a single revolt of an applied coil of glass.

The vessel is made of discoid mosaic tesserae, in florets of the following types:

A central white rod surrounded in turn by a purple and another purple with two rows of white rods in it, 10 in the interior row and 20 in the exterior.

A central greenish-gray rod surrounded by six trapezoidal petals outlined in white, which is set in a purple layer.

One tessera on the rim, as for decorative highlight: thin, wavy, yellow stripes in a thick, translucent green layer.

The coil of the base is ribbon mosaic comprising parallel layers of white and purple glass.
