## Condition

Body fragment.

## Description

Tesserae of a single type, a rosette with two layers of petals: a central red rod surrounded by six turquoise trapezoidal petals, all of them set in white, then an outer layer of seven petals each one consisting of a central yellow rod set in translucent purple glass.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the production technique see comments on [85.AF.85](#cat). On the trade of small fragments of mosaic glass in the nineteenth century and on the different techniques and classes of mosaic glass present in the JPGM collection, see comments on [76.AF.70.21](#cat). It is quite probable that this belongs to the same vessel as [83.AF.28.6](#cat).
