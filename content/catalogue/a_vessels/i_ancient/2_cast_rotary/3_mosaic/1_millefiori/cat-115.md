Rim fragment. Wide flaring rim, rounded tip, the upper, convex part of what was probably double convex bowl. In the body three deformed florets are partly preserved in a translucent dark blue layer: (A) circular floret with a red central rod set in white, surrounded by green set in yellow spirals, surrounded by a white, a translucent light blue, and a white layer; (B) circular floret whose central part is not preserved, the outer layers are yellow petals set in green, surrounded by a white layer; (C) stripes of green, light blue, red, yellow, which may well be a severely deformed floret of type A.
