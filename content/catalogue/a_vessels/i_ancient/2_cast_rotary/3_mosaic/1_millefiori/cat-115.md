## Condition

Single fragment.

## Description

Rim fragment. Wide flaring rim, rounded tip: the upper, convex part of what was probably a double convex bowl. In the body, three deformed florets are partly preserved in a translucent dark blue layer: (1) circular floret with a red central rod set in white, surrounded by green set in yellow spirals, surrounded by a white, a translucent light blue, and a white layer; (2) circular floret, whose central part is not preserved, the outer layers of which are yellow petals set in green, surrounded by a white layer; (3) stripes of green, light blue, red, and yellow, which may well be a severely deformed floret of type 1.
