## Condition

Single body fragment; three sides are straight, probably cut in modern times.

The fragment gets thinner toward the curved end, where the body of the vessel was starting to rise.

Rectangular piece: consists of two types of rectangular tesserae: (A) heavily distorted, green eight-petaled rosette outlined in yellow set in red; (B) blue eight-petaled rosette outlined in white set in blue.

On the back side, heavily distorted, the same two types of tesserae.

Small fragments of mosaic glass vessels were sold in Rome between 1860 and 1920, where they were found, and most of the now-known examples that eventually ended in museum collections were acquired there at that period. At the time art dealers polished them to renew their bright, colorful appearance and often placed them in gold cardboard frames, giving them the appearance of a valuable object, even a jewel or a gem, like {% cat '2003.258.4' %}, {% cat '2003.258.1' %}, and {% cat '2003.258.5' %} ({% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 243–244). The fragments in the JPGM collection are quite diverse, representing different classes of mosaics, made with round florets, and shorter and longer stripes of glass in many colorful combinations. In addition to the vessel fragments, in the collection there are several ({% cat '2003.261' %}–{% cat '2003.266' %}) flat pieces that were originally formed as plaques or bands, to be used as decorative features of wall revetments and/or on movable objects such as furniture, caskets, musical or instruments; these have geometric, floral, maritime, and anthropomorphic [including theatrical masks] motifs, on which see comments on {% cat '2003.260' %}.
