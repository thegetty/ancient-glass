## Condition

Single fragment.

## Description

Mildly concave body fragment. The piece consists of one type of floret: a turquoise central rod surrounded by six green petals outlined in yellow, set in a purple layer with ca. 12 white rods. The same pattern appears on the exterior but appears distorted, with the white rods showing as white lengths.
