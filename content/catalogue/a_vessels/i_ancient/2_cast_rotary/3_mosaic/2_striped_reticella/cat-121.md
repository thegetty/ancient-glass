## Description

The bowl has a flaring lip, conical, cyma recta body, and flat bottom; stands on a tall, splaying, circular ring-base formed by a single revolt of an applied coil of glass.

The vessel is made of discoid mosaic tesserae, with florets of two types: translucent purple matrix with roughly five thin, opaque white rods; translucent purple matrix with roughly five thin, opaque yellow rods. The coil of the base is ribbon mosaic comprising parallel layers of grayish-green and purple glass.
