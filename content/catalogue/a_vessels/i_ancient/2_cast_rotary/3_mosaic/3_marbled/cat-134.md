## Description

Vertical, smooth, fire-rounded rim. Shallow convex body decorated with 19 vertical ribs, mildly slanting to the left and relatively evenly spaced. Ribs start 1.5 cm below the rim, and they are visible to the center of the bottom. In the interior, three grooves 0.1 cm thick are visible: two next to each other at the periphery of the bottom (7.1 wide and 0.1 cm thick) and a small one (W. 1.1, Th. 0.2 cm) at the center.

Composite mosaic pattern formed from polygonal sections of a composite cane of dark blue glass in which a fine, opaque white thread was spiraled two times. The sections were fused together into a single mass, which was slumped over a form-mold, and the ribs were formed by tooling while the form was on a rotating base, probably a potter’s wheel.
