## Condition

Intact.

## Description

Vertical, smooth, fire-rounded rim. Deep convex body decorated with 21 vertical ribs, slightly slanting to the left and relatively evenly spaced. Ribs begin 1.5 cm below the rim and they are visible to the center of the bottom. In the interior, one groove on the lip and two more 1.5 cm from the bottom.

Composite mosaic pattern formed from polygonal sections of a composite cane of amber-colored glass in which a fine, opaque white thread was spiraled two times. The sections were fused together into a single mass, which was slumped over a former mold, and the ribs were formed by tooling while the form was on a rotating base, probably a potter’s wheel.

## Comments and Comparanda

For agate and marbled vessels see comments on {% cat '2003.253' %}. Mosaic glass ribbed bowls are mostly found in the western Roman provinces, and it is assumed that they were probably made in Italy ({% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 73–74, 320), while monochrome ribbed bowls were made and predominantly used in the eastern Mediterranean. Preserved mosaic ribbed bowls imitate usually onyx, using either elongated, ribbon patterns, or large spirals like both examples from JPGM collection ({% cat '72.AF.37' %} and {% cat '2004.25' %}). Both patterns were probably preferred because the distortion created by the ribs enhanced the imitation of veining typical for agate.
