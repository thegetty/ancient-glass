## Condition

Single fragment.

## Description

Fragment of lower body, which seems to be shallow and convex, preserving parts of three vertical, evenly spaced ribs. Composite mosaic pattern formed from polygonal sections of a composite cane of dark purple glass in which a fine, opaque white thread was spiraled. The sections were fused together into a single mass, which was slumped over a former mold, and the ribs were created by tooling while the former was on a rotating base, probably a potter’s wheel.
