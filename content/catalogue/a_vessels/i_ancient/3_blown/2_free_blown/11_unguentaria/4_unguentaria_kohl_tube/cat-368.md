## Condition

Intact.

## Description

In-folded, tubular, and flattened flaring rim; short, wide neck; globular body, standing on a slightly concave bottom. Three thrusts with a blunt tool have given to the globular body an almost square circumference at mid-height, where a wide, horizontal fold extends on the three of the sides, while the fourth is left smooth. Three coil handles made of greenish glass extend from the shoulder to the tip of the rim arranged at equal distances. A circular scar (W. 1.2 cm) of a solid pontil is visible at the center of the bottom.
