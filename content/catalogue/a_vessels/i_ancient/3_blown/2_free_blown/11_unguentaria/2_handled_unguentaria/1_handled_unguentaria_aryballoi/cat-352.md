## Condition

Intact. Some iridescence on the interior; few pinprick bubbles.

## Description

Horizontal rim, folded out, down, and up, with an overhanging flange; short, cylindrical neck; thick-walled, spherical body; flat, slightly concave bottom. Pair of flat strap handles extend from shoulder to halfway up neck. The body is made of translucent purple glass, and the handles of transparent greenish glass.

The entire body is covered with picked-up color chips, that is, the splashware technique. The translucent purple glass \[\[paraison\]\] was marvered to incorporate flakes of various colored glass chips (opaque white, yellow, light blue, turquoise, and dark blue). Subsequently inflated, whereby the chips were distorted in the areas of greatest expansion.

## Comparanda

The form is known in core-formed glass vessels from the sixth century BCE ([2003.174](#num)–[2003.176](#num)). Free-blown glass aryballoi are a well-represented form of globular flasks used to store and transport cosmetic oils in the first and second centuries CE. There are few variants, identifiable in the shape of the rim. On the form see [[Isings 1957]], pp. 78–81, form 61; [[Sorokina 1987]], pp. 40–46 (especially 42), fig. 2:7–8; [[Israeli 2003]], pp. 42, 216; [[Antonaras 2009]], pp. 271–272, form 111 = [[Antonaras 2017]], p. 137; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 264, no. 410; [[Antonaras 2022]], p. 65, nos. 376–378. Examples decorated with splashware: [[Arakelian, Tiratzian, and Khachatrian 1969]], p. 44, no. 68, fig. 68; [[Benzian 1994]], no. 134; [[Stern 2001]], p. 67, no. 10.
