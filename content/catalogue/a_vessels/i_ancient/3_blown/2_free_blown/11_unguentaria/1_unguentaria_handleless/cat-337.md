## Condition

Intact. In some areas a black crust in the interior.

## Description

In-folded, tubular, flaring rim; short neck; ovular body compressed at four spots along its greatest diameter, thereby acquiring an irregularly polygonal shape. Stands on a concave bottom. No signs of pontil mark are visible.

## Comments and Comparanda

A well-known form ascribed to the production of fourth-century eastern workshops is the group of relatively small flasks with tubular, in-folded rim and a very wide, short, cylindrical neck leading to a pear-shaped body that almost always bears four indentations that render the body squarish ([[Stern 1977]], pp. 100–101, no. 28; [[Barkóczi 1988]], p. 151, form 131; [[Roffia 1993]], p. 108; [[Antonaras 2017]], p. 133, form 102). Analogous items have been located in the following sites and museums: Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto ([[Hayes 1975]], pp. 39, 66, plate 12, no. 153); Mainz ([[Harter 1999]], pp. 104, 246, form D21b, no. 726, plate 30); Syria: Bosra ([[Dussart 1998]], p. 92, form BVII.2423, plate 18); Israel: Samaria ([[Crowfoot 1957]], p. 409, no. 5, fig. 94/5) and Jordan: Mahayy ([[Dussart 1998]], p. 92 n. 7).

The flask was acquired with a leather-covered lidded basket, and both are part of a group of miscellaneous objects once associated with a painted wood sarcophagus ([82.AP.75](https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/105Z1T)). The absence of sediments on the glass vessel and the shape of the basket, which does not correspond to that of the flask but quite faithfully renders a first-century mold-blown pyxis like [2003.315](#num), suggest that they were not an original assemblage.
