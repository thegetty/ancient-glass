## Condition

Fully preserved, but heavily weathered. Has such strong iridescence that it is difficult to discern the original color, but the glass may have originally been colorless.

## Description

Fire-polished rim, conical mouth; wide, short neck with a constriction at its base that forms a diaphragm; piriform body; flat, slightly convex bottom. The short, fine base-ring hardly covers the curve of the bottom. At the center of the bottom a crescent-shape pontil mark (W. ca. 1 cm) is visible.

The body is decorated with snake-thread decoration formed by a thread with horizontal ridges. The one continuous thread, forming a wide triangle at the start—probably rendering the snake’s head—is wavy, with two rows of higher coils dividing the vessel’s body into three parts, ending with a high coil above the serpent’s “head.”
