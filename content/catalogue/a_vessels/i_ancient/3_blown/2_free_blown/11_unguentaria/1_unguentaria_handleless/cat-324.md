## Condition

Intact, with a few scratches and nicks. Some incrustation on the interior of the mouth and some discoloration and iridescence on the body.

## Description

In-folded and flattened, flaring rim; cylindrical neck, constricted at its base; ovular body, standing on three pinched toes created by pinching the gather, pulling it down, and bending it out 90 degrees. A white thread of glass has been spirally wound 17 times from the center of the bottom to the rim. The pinching necessary for the shaping of the toes distorted the pattern of the spirals on the lower part of the vessel, forming a wavy pattern.
