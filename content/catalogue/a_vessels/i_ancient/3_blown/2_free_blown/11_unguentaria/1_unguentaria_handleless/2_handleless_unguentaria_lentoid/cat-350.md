## Condition

Mended. Comprised of two parts from two vessels. The first one is the mouth, which is mostly covered with a wax-like substance concealing the true nature of the fragment. The second is the body of the vessel. Some white weathering and iridescence on parts of the exterior; incrustation in areas of the interior.

## Description

The rim is actually an everted, conical, pushed-in foot of a stemmed beaker. Narrow neck probably once ended in a diaphragm; ovular body, slightly concave bottom; four pinched feet. At the center of the bottom an annular pontil mark (W. ca. 1, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible. Two rows of pinched protuberances are arranged around the body, nine on the upper body and ten on the lower body.
