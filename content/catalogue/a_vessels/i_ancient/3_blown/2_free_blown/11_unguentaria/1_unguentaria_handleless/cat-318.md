## Condition

Partly preserved; mended and filled. Small areas with iridescent weathering.

## Description

Fine, in-folded, flaring rim; cylindrical neck; squat bulbous body, standing on a flat bottom. A white thread of glass has been spirally wound approximately 30 times from the center of the bottom, where a large circular dot is visible, to the rim. The thread has been dragged upward five times to form a festooned pattern, imitating agate.
