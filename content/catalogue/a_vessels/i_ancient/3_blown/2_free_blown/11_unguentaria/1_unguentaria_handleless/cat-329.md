## Condition

Fully preserved; some cracks along the body. Some iridescence on the exterior.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; cylindrical neck, widening toward the squat, bulbous body; slightly convex bottom. No pontil mark visible.

A fine white thread was spirally wound 18 times from the middle of the neck to the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

Bulbous and globular unguentaria appear from the early first century CE, and during the same century they become one of the most widespread forms of flask, known in both the eastern and the western Roman provinces ({% cite 'Stern 1977' %}, p. 35; {% cite 'De Tommaso 1990' %}, pp. 39–40, type 5). They are often decorated with spirally wound threads, more often than not left unmarvered ({% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, p. 146, form 122a, wherein several parallels are cited). For additional parallels see {% cite 'Dusenbery 1967' %}, p. 41, nos. 16, 17, figs. 17–18; {% cite 'Barag 1970a' %}, vol. 2, plate 41, type XV:1-1; {% cite 'Stern 2001' %}, p. 57, no. 1; {% cite 'Israeli 2003' %}, p. 116, no. 103; {% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005' %}, p. 201, no. 564; {% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, p. 212, no. 317.
