## Condition

Mended and weathered. The surface is iridescent and pitted.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim, with a cutout fold underneath it, giving the impression of an applied coil. Short and wide neck severely constricted at its base, creating a diaphragm; globular body, flat, slightly concave bottom. An annular pontil mark (W. 2.2, Th. 0.1 cm) on the bottom. A red trail has been wound spirally around the vessel from rim to bottom; it has been dragged 14 times, forming festoons.
