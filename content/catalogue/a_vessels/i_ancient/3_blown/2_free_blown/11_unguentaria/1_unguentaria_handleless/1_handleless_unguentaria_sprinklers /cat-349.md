## Condition

Intact. Some white weathering and iridescence on parts of the exterior; incrustation in areas of the interior.

## Description

Fire-polished, rounded rim; funnel mouth; short, cylindrical neck, severely constricted at its base, creating a diaphragm; globular body; slightly concave bottom. At the center of the bottom an annular pontil mark (W. ca. 1, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible. Eight pinched protuberances are arranged roughly in two rows around the body.
