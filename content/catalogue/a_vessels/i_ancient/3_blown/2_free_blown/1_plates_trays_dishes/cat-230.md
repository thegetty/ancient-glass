## Description

Fire-polished rim; concave walls tapering toward the flat, slightly concave bottom. On the interior there is incised decoration: 0.5 cm below the rim is one shallow groove, which is 0.4 cm wide; and at mid-body height (2.2 cm below the rim) is one band of parallel, shallow incisions.

## Comparanda

This form of plate is widely distributed, mainly in the western Roman provinces, and is dated in the fourth and fifth centuries CE. The incised decoration, which is found on them quite often, indicates that they must had been made in various sites, both in Italy and in the eastern Mediterranean ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 36–37, form 18 or rather form 116, pp. 143–144; [[Fünfschilling 2015]], pp. 322–323, form AR 55.1; [[Antonaras 2017]], pp. 66–67, form 16, wherein many parallels are cited).
