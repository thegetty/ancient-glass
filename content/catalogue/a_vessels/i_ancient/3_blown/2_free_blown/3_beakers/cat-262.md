## Condition

Intact. Some weathering has produced iridescence, primarily on the inside of the vessel.

## Description

Mildly flaring, uneven, lopsided, fire-polished rim; conical body; pushed-in conical base; flat bottom, slightly concave at the very center. Nineteen pinched vertical ribs, unequal in height and distance, most of them slightly slanting to the right, toward the rim. No pontil mark on the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

This beaker is a rare variant of well-known first-century glass beakers ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 47–50, forms 33, 35), differing in the pinched, vertical ribs. It seems that it is quite rare and the only really close parallel was found in Aquincum, Hungary ([[Barkóczi 1988]], p. 91, no. 129, plates XII, LXXV) from a grave dated to the early second century CE. Also, cf. [[Loeschke, Niessen, and Willers 1911]], plate XLIV: 1109, a ribbed beaker with additional horizontal threads.

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Ingrid Reisser (Böblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2004
