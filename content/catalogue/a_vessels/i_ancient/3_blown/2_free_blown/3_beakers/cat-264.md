## Condition

Fully preserved; mended from fragments; iridescence and in some areas incrustation on the exterior; few pinprick bubbles.

## Description

Fire-polished, slightly flaring rim; long, conical body, curving and sloping toward the bottom. The body is standing, slightly off-center, on a low, cylindrical stem; conical, slightly deformed, pushed-in base, forming a disk foot. Faint pontil mark (W. ca. 0.8 cm) is visible on the undersurface of the base .

## Comments and Comparanda

Free-blown stemmed goblets appear from the first century CE, with several fine, ornate examples extant ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 50–52, 56, forms 36, 40). Stemmed beakers were re-introduced in the Early Byzantine period (fifth–seventh centuries), probably sometime in the fifth century; these were simple utilitarian vessels, mostly undecorated, used as drinking vessels and lamps ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 139–140, form 111; [[Antonaras 2009]], pp. 162–167, form 35 = [[Antonaras 2017]], pp. 82–83). Stemmed beakers are the most widespread form of glass vessel in the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea region from the fifth century and at least until the seventh century CE ([[Barag 1970a]], vol. 2, plate 33, type V:9; [[Dussart 1998]], pp. 115–120, type B.IX.1, plates 27–28; [[Stern 2001]], pp. 310–311, nos. 173–174; [[Israeli 2003]], p. 198, no. 237; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 139, nos. 192–193). The broad distribution and the variations in the shape of the body and the base indicate that stemmed beakers were produced in many places ([[Foy 1995]], pp. 208–209, form 23a; [[Sternini 1995a]], p. 257; [[Antonaras 2010b]]; [[Antonaras 2014a]]). It seems that their production underwent a great expansion when glassblowers devised a method to form the entire vessel from a single mass of glass ([[Stern 2001]], pp. 270–271; [[Weinberg and Stern 2009]], pp. 148–149). The lower part of the \[\[paraison\]\] was folded in and squeezed to form the base and the stem quite quickly ([[Antonaras 2009b]], pp. 162–167, form 35 = [[Antonaras 2017]], pp. 82–83). This new technique required much less glass than the earlier technique, in which the bowl and the base of the vessel were made from two different \[\[paraisons\]\] ([[Antonaras 2009b]], pp. 165–166, form 37 = [[Antonaras 2017]], pp. 85–87). Stemmed beakers are found in great numbers in the excavations of churches, where they were apparently used chiefly as lamps ([[Antonaras 2007]], pp. 51–54; [[Antonaras 2014b]], pp. 100–101, 103).
