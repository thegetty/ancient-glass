## Comments and Comparanda

Acquired with the bowl {% cat '2003.379.2' %}. This shape of beaker is known from several sites, mostly in the western Roman Empire ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, p. 51, form 36b; {% cite 'Whitehouse 1997a' %}, p. 228, no. 387; {% cite 'von Saldern 1980b' %}, p. 118, no. 117; {% cite 'Fünfschilling 2015' %}, pp. 310–311, form AR 42). Furthermore, beakers with a slightly different bell-shaped body but with applied conical base and thread around the neck are known from Milan ({% cite 'Roffia 1993' %}, pp. 89, 92, no. 79) and Croatia ({% cite 'Alfano 1997' %}, p. 198, no. 203). Also, very similar beakers with the same body but with folded base are known from Samothrace ({% cite 'Dusenbery 1967' %}, p. 46, no. 42) and Crete ({% cite 'von Saldern 1968' %}, no. 54) as well as unknown provenances ({% cite 'Auth 1976' %}, p. 206, no. 376; {% cite 'Matheson 1980' %}, p. 42, no. 113; {% cite 'Hayes 1975' %}, p. 57, no. 137, fig. 3, plate 10).
