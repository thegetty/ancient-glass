## Condition

This beaker is severely weathered. Its surface bears extensive iridescence, dark accretions, and flaking.

## Description

Cut-off, probably mildly polished rim; conical body, standing on a low, slightly protruding bottom. The vessel is decorated with wheel-cutting. Two parallel, horizontal grooves form a rib at mid-body height. Another set of grooves forms a rib at the lower end of the body. The base is conical, wheel-cut as well. The bottom is wheel-cut at its perimeter, leaving a central raised disk (Diam. 2.5 cm). In addition, some anomalies at the center of the bottom might be interpreted as a pontil scar (1 × 0.9 cm).
