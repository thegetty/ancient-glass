## Condition

Intact; large areas covered with whitish weathering.

## Description

Thickened, fire-polished rim; flaring mouth; conical body with four vertical indentations on its lower part. It stands on a tall, pushed-in, conical base. An annular pontil mark (W. 2.1, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible on the underside.

## Comments and Comparanda

This particular form of beaker is probably a descendant of the mid-imperial (second–third centuries) indented beakers without a base-ring known from eastern Mediterranean sites ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 49–50, form 35; Cyprus: [[Vessberg 1956]], beaker type IV.α.2., pp. 142–143, fig. 44:34; [[Lightfoot 2007]], pp. 92–97, nos. 77–83; Thera: [[Dragendorff et al. 1903]], p. 286 fig. 481:t–u). Published examples with pushed-in, conical base are known from Cologne ([[La Baume and Salomonson 1976]], no. 161); Hungary ([[Barkóczi 1988]], p. 87, no. 117, plate XI.LXXV); Türkiye ([[Akat, Fıratlı and Kocabaş 1984]], no. 291), Myrina ([[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], p. 450, no. 1264, plate 112); as well as two that are unprovenanced ([[Whitehouse 1997a]], p. 113, no. 173; [[Israeli 2003]], p. 163, no. 171). In addition, a flask from Syria, dated to the third–fourth centuries, is essentially a narrow and slender variant of this form ([[Kunina 1997]], p. 333, no. 403).

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
