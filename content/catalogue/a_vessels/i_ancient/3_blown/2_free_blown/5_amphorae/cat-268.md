Intact; small areas with milky crust.

## Description

Fire-polished, slightly flaring rim; cylindrical neck; horizontal shoulder; truncated, conical body; pointed, convex bottom. Pair of peacock-blue, angular, coil handles from shoulder to mid-neck. Peacock-blue coil wound once around neck at level of handles’ attachment—apparently placed before the handles were attached. At the center of the bottom is an annular pontil mark (W. 1.5, Th. 0.1 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

Small glass amphoras rendering in miniature the shape of large clay amphoras were quite popular and were used as tableware for serving wine. This vessel belongs to a distinctive group of Syro-Palestinian glass table amphoras, appearing in four different types, which have been dated to the fourth and fifth centuries CE ([[Stern 1977]], pp. 84–85). This particular vessel, due to its tall, tubular neck that is not constricted at its base, is ascribed to type I or II. The slightly flaring rim led us to ascribe it to the rarer type II. On the basis of its long, conical body, the absence of a base, the presence of a decorative coil halfway down neck, it is ascribed to type IIA2a ([[Stern 1977]], pp. 84–85). The findspots indicate that they may have been produced in Syria, possibly in the fourth century CE ([[Hayes 1975]], p. 110, no. 411, plate 25; [[Stern 1977]], pp. 84–85, type IIA2a; [[Stern 2001]], no. 98, p. 208; [[Barag 1970a]], vol. 2, plate 37, type 10.2; [[Dekoulakou 1976]], p. 103, plate 81:β, γ; [[Papageorgiou 2014]], p. 447, no. 130; cf.
