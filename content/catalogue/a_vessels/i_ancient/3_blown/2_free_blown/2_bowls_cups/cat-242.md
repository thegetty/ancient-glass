Intact; some areas covered with iridescent weathering; very few pinprick bubbles.

In-folded and flattened, flaring rim; conical body; pushed-in base-ring; concave bottom. Pair of crimped coil (pseudo-)handles on opposite sides of the rim. At the center of the bottom is a faint annular pontil mark.

## Comments and Comparanda

These conical bowls with the characteristic horizontal, crimped pseudo-handles are widely distributed in both the eastern and western provinces of the Roman Empire. They were produced during the first century CE, and they occasionally appear in the early second century as well; considered to be an Italian product ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, p. 59, form 43; {% cite 'Stern 1977' %}, pp. 57–58; {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, p. 59, form 11).
