Intact.

## Description

Rough, cracked-off, slightly flaring rim; hemispherical body; slightly concave bottom. Around the body, 2 cm below rim, are 22 unevenly spaced, vertical pinched ribs. A white thread is wound around the vessel from the center of the bottom to just below the rim. Four rotations in the area below rim, ten rotations on the ribs (faint between the ribs), and at least two more on the lowest part of the body. An additional thread applied on the neck and wound three times, continuing the thread that covers the body, which finishes right above the ribs.
