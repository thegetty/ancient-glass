## Condition

Intact; parts covered with milky crust and iridescence; very few pinprick bubbles.

## Description

Out-folded, tubular rim; convex body walls form a hemispherical body that tapers toward the flat bottom. The vessel rests on an applied pad base. In the interior of the vessel a relief ring (W. 1.5, Th. 0.5 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom. This was probably formed when the pontil, which was attached on the bottom for the shaping of the rim, was removed, before the pad base was applied. At the center of the base a circular pontil scar (W. 1.1 cm) is visible.

## Comments and Comparanda

This form of bowl with a distinctive inward-leaning, flattened tubular rim is defined by the out-folded tubular rim, which can be either vertical, everted, or inward-leaning, and the hemispherical body on a pushed-in base. The form appears around the middle of the first century CE, and becomes very popular in Flavian times ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 59–60, form 44a). There are dozens of comparanda from Italy and the Adriatic region, all of them dated to the first century CE and ascribed to a North Italian workshop ({% cite 'Calvi 1968' %}, pp. 67–68, group C, plate C:7; {% cite 'Roffia 1993' %}, p. 78, no. 47; {% cite 'Mandruzzato and Marcante 2005' %}, pp. 28, 96–97, nos. 232–235, 237; {% cite 'Bonomi 1996' %}, p. 163, nos. 368, 369; {% cite 'Pesavento-Mattioli and Cipriano 1992' %}, p. 135, tomb 1, fig. 4:12–13; {% cite 'Toniolo 2000' %}, p. 124; {% cite 'Casagrande and Ceselin 2003' %}, p. 177, nos. 266, 267; {% cite 'Larese 2004' %}, pp. 49–50; {% cite 'Alfano 1997' %}, p. 175, no. 156; {% cite 'Facchini 1999' %}, pp. 252–253, nos. 606–609; {% cite 'Roffia 1993' %}, p. 78, no. 47; {% cite 'Biaggio Simona 1991' %}, pp. 83–85, form 5.3.4., figs. 41, 42).
