## Description

## Comments and Comparanda

Among the finds from Egyptian sites there are several deep bowls with conical and convex-shaped body, standing on a base-ring. There is a group with a distinctive, considerably wide, horizontal rim that had either a fire-polished lip or one that was folded at the end, forming a vertical lip suited for the securing of a lid; they are dated to the fifth–sixth centuries ({% cite 'Harden 1936' %}, pp. 95–98, form deep bowls A.I.b.I, A.III.a; {% cite 'Whitehouse 1997a' %}, pp. 81–82, nos. 107–110; {% cite 'Hayes 1975' %}, pp. 2–3, for their re-dating, on the basis of pottery co-finds from the third–fourth to the fifth–sixth centuries).
