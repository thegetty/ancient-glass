## Condition

Intact; covered with iridescent weathering; encrusted on the interior. Decorative thread has partly fallen off.

## Description

Fire-polished rim; slightly everted, cylindrical body curving in toward the pushed-in ring-base. No sign of pontil mark on the bottom. A fine thread was spirally wound 16 times from the bottom to under the rim. It is not preserved anywhere; only the traces/trail of its path remains visible on the upper five revolutions.
