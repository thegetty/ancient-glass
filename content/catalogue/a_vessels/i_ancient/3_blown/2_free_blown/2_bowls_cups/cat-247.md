## Condition

Intact; some iridescent weathering on the interior.

## Description

Flaring rim, folded out and down to form a collar; body cylindrical, slightly tapering and curving toward the bottom, which is slightly concave. No pontil mark visible on the bottom.

## Comments

Acquired with the beaker [2003.379.1](#num). The shape of the vessel and its rim permit us to hypothesize that it was used as a liner for a metal lamp.

## Comparanda

There are known parallels from Herculaneum dated before 79 CE ([[Scatozza Höricht 1986]], p. 37, no. 53, form 14b); Zadar ([[Ravagnan 1994]], p. 192, no. 383); Siphnos, from a grave dated to the first century CE ([[Mackworth-Young 1949]], p. 82, p. 85, plate 28,1); and Cyprus ([[Vessberg 1956]], p. 170, fig. 50, no. 37); and at least two more of unrecorded provenance ([[Hayes 1975]], p. 56, no. 131, fig. 3, plate 8; [[Whitehouse 1997a]], p. 76, no. 95).

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
