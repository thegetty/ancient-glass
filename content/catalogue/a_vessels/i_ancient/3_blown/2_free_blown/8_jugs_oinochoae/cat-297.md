## Description

Fine, in-folded rim; trefoil mouth; wide, cylindrical neck; horizontal shoulder; pear-shaped body, standing on a pushed-in, conical ring-base. Concave bottom with a central kick.

A wide strap handle with three ribs is applied on the shoulder and ends on the rim, where it folds, forming a thumb-rest tab.
