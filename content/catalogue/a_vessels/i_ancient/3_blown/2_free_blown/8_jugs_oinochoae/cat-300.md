## Condition

Fully preserved; mended. Iridescence covers the interior and small areas on the ends of the handle and the mouth on the exterior.

## Description

Fire-polished rim; trefoil mouth; cylindrical neck; globular body decorated at maximum diameter with five indentations; concave bottom. At the center of the bottom an annular pontil mark (W. 1.6 cm) is visible. A fine thread is spirally wound five times around the mouth. A fine coil handle is applied on the shoulder and terminates, folded, under the rim. A coil was wound twice around the lower neck; now only the wide wad of glass where it was applied on the vessel is preserved, along with a trace of the rest of its path.

## Comparanda

Jugs with same body shape are known from Syro-Palestinian sites, usually with smooth body and plain rim ({% cite 'Filarska 1952' %}, p. 153, no. 148, plate 33; {% cite 'Weinberg 1988' %}, pp. 66–67, nos. 207–214; [[Crowfoot 1957]], p. 416, fig. 96:9; {% cite 'Matheson 1980' %}, p. 89, no. 241; {% cite 'Whitehouse 2001a' %}, p. 183, nos. 726–727) or rarely with trefoil mouth ({% cite 'Auth 1976' %}, p. 208, no. 386), dated in the fourth or fifth century CE.

The indentation around the body is not noted among the parallels cited above. Glassworkers aimed to imitate hammered silver vessels, which were often decorated with smaller or bigger indentations from the first century CE, and during the fourth century it became very popular for Syro-Palestinian products, mostly on small unguentaria, whose bodies were rendered practically square by these indentations ({% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, pp. 159–160, form 141, nos. 668–680, plate 41), and jars ({% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, pp. 195–196, nos. 282–285).
