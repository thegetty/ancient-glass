## Condition

Intact.

## Description

Slightly in-folded rim; short conical mouth; cylindrical neck; globular body with four indentations around it, giving it an uneven octagonal shape; concave bottom. At the center of the bottom an annular pontil mark (Diam. 1 × 0.7 cm) is visible.

A dark blue coil with several ferrous impurities is attached on the shoulder and, bending, forms a curved handle that is reattached on the neck at mid-height. The same coil continues, spirally wound six times around the mouth.

## Comments and Comparanda

The use of turquoise blue coil in the decoration of bowls and various forms of flasks and jugs is typical for the Syrian region in the sixth–seventh centuries CE ({% cite 'Jennings 2004/5' %}, pp. 155–168; {% cite 'Foy 2000' %}, pp. 259–268, and particularly on jugs pp. 266–267).
