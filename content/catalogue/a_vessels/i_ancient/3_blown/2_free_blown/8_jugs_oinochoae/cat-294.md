Unevenly in-folded, tubular, flaring rim; cylindrical neck; globular body; pushed-in ring-base; flat, slightly concave bottom. No pontil mark visible on the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

This jug belongs to a quite widespread form known mainly from the western parts of the Roman Empire ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 69–70, form 52a; {% cite 'Sternini 1991' %}, vol. 2, p. 121, nos. 492–493; {% cite 'Stern 2001' %}, p. 92, no. 30) and Cyprus ({% cite 'Vessberg 1952' %}, plate VI:11–13; {% cite 'Lightfoot 2007' %}, p. 81, no. 175). The form also appears in examples with a squatter body, including: {% cite 'Matheson 1980' %}, p. 32, no. 92; {% cite 'Kunina 1997' %}, p. 303, no. 250; {% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005' %}, pp. 45–46, nos. 44–45.
