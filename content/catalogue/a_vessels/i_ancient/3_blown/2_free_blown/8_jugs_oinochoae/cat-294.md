## Condition

Intact; crust of weathering and iridescence on parts of the vessel.

## Description

Unevenly in-folded, tubular, flaring rim; cylindrical neck; globular body; pushed-in ring-base; flat, slightly concave bottom. No pontil mark visible on the bottom. A lopsided strap handle with three grooves is applied on the shoulder, stretches upward, folds (forming a thumb-rest tab), and ends on the upper neck.

## Comparanda

This jug belongs to a quite widespread form known mainly from the western parts of the Roman Empire ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 69–70, form 52a; [[Sternini 1991]], vol. 2, p. 121, nos. 492–493; [[Stern 2001]], p. 92, no. 30) and Cyprus ([[Vessberg 1952]], plate VI:11–13; [[Lightfoot 2007]], p. 81, no. 175). The form appears with examples with squatter body, including: [[Matheson 1980]], p. 32, no. 92; [[Kunina 1997]], p. 303, no. 250; [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], pp. 45–46, nos. 44–45.
