Fully preserved; a small crack is visible on the lip. Some iridescence visible on the exterior and some reddish soil in the interior.

## Description

Fire-polished rim; trefoil mouth; cylindrical neck; globular body; concave bottom. An annular pontil mark (1.5 × 1 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.

A greenish coil is wound under the rim and at mid-neck height. In addition, a turquoise thread was wound five times around the upper body, and below it is a zigzag thread. A coil handle was added on the shoulder and ends on the lip.

## Comments and Comparanda

This jug is a characteristic example of Syro-Palestinian glass production in the late fourth century CE. It is very close to the mold-blown jug [2003.427](#num). This group, known as the Blue Zigzag Group, includes several similar vessels—jugs, jars, and spouted flasks—that are made of the same greenish glass, and they are decorated with threads of turquoise glass spirally wound or in zigzags ([[Stern 1977]], pp. 120–122). Several examples are published.
