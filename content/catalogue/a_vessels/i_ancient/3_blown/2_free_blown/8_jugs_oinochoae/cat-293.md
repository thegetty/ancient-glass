## Condition

Fully preserved. The weathered surface gives the vessel an iridescent blue and brown color.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim, a small part in-folded. Ovoid body, gradually tapering along the elongated upper part, which ends smoothly under the rim. A thick coil of transparent bluish glass forms the applied base-ring. The coil handle is of transparent blue glass, starts at lower body, and, forming a high curve, attaches at the rim.

For dip mold–blown examples see {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, p. 120, form 81).
