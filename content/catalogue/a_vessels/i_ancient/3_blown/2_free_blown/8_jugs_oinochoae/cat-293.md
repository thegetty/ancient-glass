## Condition

Fully preserved. The weathered surface gives the vessel an iridescent blue and brown color.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim, a small part in-folded; ovoid body, gradually tapering along the elongated upper part, which ends smoothly under the rim. A thick coil of transparent bluish glass forms the applied base-ring. The coil handle, of transparent blue glass, starts at the lower body and, forming a high curve, attaches at the rim.
