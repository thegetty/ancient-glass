## Comments and Comparanda

Small glass amphoras rendering in miniature the shape of large clay amphoras were quite popular and were used as tableware for serving wine. This vessel belongs to a distinctive group of Syro-Palestinian table glass amphoras, appearing in four different types, which have been dated to the fourth and fifth centuries CE ([[Stern 1977]], pp. 84–85). This particular vessel, due to its tall, tubular neck, constricted at its base, is ascribed to type III. On the basis of its long, conical body, the presence of a base, and the absence of a decorative coil halfway down the neck, it is ascribed to type IIIB1b ([[Stern 1977]], pp. 84–85, fig. 3). The findspots indicate that they may have been produced in Palestine, possibly beginning in the first half of the fourth century CE: [[Barag 1970a]], vol. 2, plate 37, type 10.6 (variant). Also, cf. [[Auth 1976]], p. 131, no. 164; [[Bomford 1976]], no. 164; [[Oliver 1980]], p. 124, no. 218; [[Stern 2001]], pp. 146–149, pp. 210–211, nos. 100–101.
