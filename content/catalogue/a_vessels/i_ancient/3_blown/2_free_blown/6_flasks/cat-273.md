## Comments and Comparanda

The vessel is made of decolorized glass, which was much more valuable and expensive than ordinary greenish glass. In Roman times glass decolorized with manganese or antimony appears from the last third of the first century CE until the beginning of the fourth century CE, but it was most in fashion and had its highest distribution levels from the second quarter of the second to the mid-third century, which is exactly the production period of this flask. It was used mainly in western Europe and mostly for tableware, although bottles and unguentaria appear in colorless glass as well ([[Foy et al. 2018]], vol. 1, pp. xiii–xvii; [[Stern 2020]], pp. 769–774). This particular flask form appears in the western provinces, on the Black Sea coast, and in Asia Minor, produced in several centers ([[Foy et al. 2018]], vol. 2. pp. 250–252, form IN 250; [[Isings 1957]], pp. 121–122, form 103; [[Fünfschillng 2015]], pp. 422–423, form AR 154.1; [[Antonaras 2009]], pp. 190–92, form 50).
