## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; cylindrical neck, tapering toward the body; globular body; flat, concave bottom. A circular, solid pontil mark (W. 1.5 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

This flask belongs to a variant of the well-known short-necked, bulbous unguentaria that appear in the first century in all Mediterranean Roman provinces ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 22–23, form 6). In this variant the body is considerably more voluminous and the bottom is wider than in some comparable finds from Italy ([[De Tommaso 1991]], p. 39, type 4; [[Mandruzzato and Marcante 2007]], pp. 65–66, nos. 59–61) and Dalmatia ([[Ravagnan 1994]], p. 83, nos. 148–149), all of them dated to the first century CE.

## Provenance

Pierre Mavrogordato, Greek, 1870–1948 (Berlin, Germany); by 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
