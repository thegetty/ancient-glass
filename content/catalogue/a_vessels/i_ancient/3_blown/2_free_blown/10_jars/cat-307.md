## Condition

Intact; dark brown and iridescent weathering cover the interior and parts of the exterior.

## Description

Rim folded out, down, and up. Cylindrical neck, sloping shoulders, square body, flat bottom. A smooth strap handle of the same material is attached on the shoulder and bent at a right angle, ending at upper neck area below the rim. Three concentric circular ridges (Diam. 1.5, 3.5, 5 cm) are faintly visible on three sides of the body—possibly remains of the mold used to shape the sides, or probably the result of the uneven cooling down of the glass. As none of the body edges are straight and the sides are quite different, the vessel may be either a crooked mold-blown product or a free-blown product.
