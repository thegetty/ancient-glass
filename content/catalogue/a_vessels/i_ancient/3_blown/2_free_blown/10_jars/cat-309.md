## Condition

Fully preserved; a chip missing from the rim. Mostly covered by yellowish iridescence and opaque whitish weathering.

## Description

In-folded, flaring rim; short, wide, cylindrical neck; globular body, standing on three pinched toes. Two handles are applied around the neck. Each handle starts from the neck, forming a tiny thumb rest on the top, and stretches, forming a fine curve that ends on the upper body. A fine thread starting on the shoulder is wound seven times around the shoulders and the lower part of the neck. No pontil mark visible on the bottom.

## Comparanda

Flasks with three feet with flat, band-like pinched toes are well-known from the first century (considered to be Italian products: see [[Stern 1976]], pp. 53–54, no. 13; [[De Tommaso 1991]], p. 54, type 25; {% cite 'Lightfoot 2017' %}, p. 188, no. 229). Simpler pinched toes are known from the second–third centuries CE ({% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, p. 213, no. 320). A fourth-century amphoriskos with identical toes is in the collection of the Allard Pierson Museum, Amsterdam (no. 6069).

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
