## Condition

Almost fully preserved. Some fragments have been reattached, and some are still missing from the body. The vessel bears only light weathering.

## Description

Fire-polished rim, rounded; funnel mouth with a tubular horizontal flange; ovular body with slightly concave bottom. It has a fairly deep kick and a solid pontil mark (W. 1.2 cm). Seven vertical indentations around the body.

## Comments and Comparanda

This form of jar, with the characteristic flange at mid-height of the neck, is widely distributed in the Syro-Palestinian region, known in examples with globular and ovular body occasionally decorated with applied threads, indentations, or dip mold–blown or pinched ribs. The flange indicates that these jars were not used for drinking or pouring liquids ([[Stern 2001]], pp. 150–151). Published comparanda include the following: indented jars [[Barag 1970a]], vol. 2, plate 34, type VI:7-1; [[Israeli 2003]], p. 237, no. 302 (handled example); plain examples: [[Bagatti and Milik 1958]], p. 147, fig. 35:3; [[Seligman et al. 1996]], p. 50, fig. 15:4; [[Whitehouse 1997a]], p. 164, no. 285; [[Israeli 2003a]], p. 238, nos. 305, 306; [[Antonaras 2012]], pp. 197–198, nos. 288–291.
