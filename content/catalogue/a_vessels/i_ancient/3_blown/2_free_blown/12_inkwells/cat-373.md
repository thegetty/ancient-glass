## Condition

Mostly covered by white crust from weathering.

## Description

In-folded, horizontal, fire-polished rim; shallow, sloping shoulder; cylindrical body, slightly wider moving downward, with horizontal flange at top and bottom, which forms base-ring; slightly convex bottom, pushed in at center, no pontil mark visible.

Free-blown and tooled, circular lid with an oval protuberance at the center of the upper surface. It is formed like a small vessel with a wide, cylindrical neck and bulbous body, then folded and pressed, forming a wide horizontal, slightly convex band. This band secured the lid on the opening of the vessel. It continues as a wide, cylindrical tube, mildly tapering toward its end. The end is broken, and its exact shape remains unknown, but a small, preserved part of it indicates that it was bent and protruding.
