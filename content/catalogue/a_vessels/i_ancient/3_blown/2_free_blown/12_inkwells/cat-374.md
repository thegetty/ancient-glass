## Condition

Intact. Incrustation on the inside.

## Description

Small, circular opening at the center of a wide, horizontal, concave rim. A fold of the glass forms a ridge at the transition to the conical body, which tapers to the base; the bottom is slightly concave. A thick coil handle starts on the lower part of the body, forms a small ring, and ends on the ridge. A very fine annular pontil scar (W. 1.8, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible in the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

On inkwells in general see comments on [2003.453](#num). The closest parallel to [2003.378](#num) is an unpublished find from the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (17.194.119): http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/249364. For an example with similar body shape, with one handle from Syria, ascribed to a Syro-Palestinian production and dated to the second century CE, see [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], pp. 187, 249, no. 752, with further bibliography. Two other examples are known from Corinth, dated to the first and early second century, respectively: [[Davidson 1952]], p. 101, no. 636, fig. 8; [[Antonaras 2022]], pp. 68–69, 119, no. 443.
