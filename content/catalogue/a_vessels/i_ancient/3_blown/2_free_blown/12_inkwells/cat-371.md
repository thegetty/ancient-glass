## Condition

Intact; some incrustation in the interior.

## Description

Trefoil, fire-polished rim; cutaway conical mouth; conical body; flat bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

No parallels have been located. The glass appears to be late antique. Possibly connected to Syro-Palestinian production, but the shape and the rendering of the rim remain unparalleled.

## Provenance

Pierre Mavrogordato, Greek, 1870–1948 (Berlin, Germany); by 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
