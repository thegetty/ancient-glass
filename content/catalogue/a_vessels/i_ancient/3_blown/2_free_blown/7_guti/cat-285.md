## Condition

Intact. Iridescence and even black crust cover the interior.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; trefoil mouth, wide, cylindrical neck; body pulled to form a spout at its end, assuming the shape of a bird; mildly concave bottom. The tip of the tail is open and has been open from the beginning, as its fire-rounded tip clearly indicates.

The pouring slit of the trefoil mouth is inconveniently placed over the body, making it difficult to pour the liquid contents of the vessel from there.

## Comments and Comparanda

The actual use of these vessels remains uncertain. There is a testimony in the sources that they were indeed baby feeders ([[Hilgers 1969]], s.v. “titina” or “ubuppa,” p. 80) but it has also been proposed that they were used for the filling of oil lamps ([[McFadden 1946]], p. 475, no. 32; [[Isings 1957]], p. 118) or some sort of a drip feeder for medicinal liquids ([[Welker 1974]], pp. 95–98). The more likely hypothesis seems to be that they were used for filling oil lamps, especially clay lamps: their very small filling holes would seem to necessitate the use of a funnel or a spout. However, the obvious discrepancy between the large number of lamps found in excavations and the small number of glass “lamp fillers” does not support this hypothesis unreservedly ([[Antonaras 2017]], pp. 102–103). For parallels of baby feeders (guti) see ([[Vessberg 1952]], pp. 148–149, gutus type, plates X:1–2, XX:4–5; [[Barag 1970a]], vol. 2, plate 47, type XXIII:2; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 165, nos. 234–235; [[Antonaras 2009]], form 53a = [[Antonaras 2017]], p. 102).
