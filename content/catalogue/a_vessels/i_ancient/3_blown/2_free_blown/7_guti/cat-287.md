## Condition

Complete; a few small chips are broken from the rim.

## Description

Cracked-off, vertical rim; conical mouth and neck, tapering toward the body, which is ovular, with pinched, pointed end. The flask stands on a slightly conical bottom. No pontil scar.

## Comments and Comparanda

A simplified version—with its simple, pinched bottom—of a relatively well-known form of askos (a wineskin in ancient Greek, that is, a container for wine made of animal skin) with an s-shaped ending for the bottom ([[Berger 1960]], p. 84, no. 224, plates 15, 22; [[Hayes 1975]], p. 66, no. 197; [[von Saldern 1974]], p. 157, no. 237; [[Bomford 1976]], p. 22, no. 67; [[Stern 2001]], p. 113, no. 43; [[Massabò 2001]], pp. 118–119, no. 69; [[Israeli 2003]], p. 118, no. 109; [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], p. 197, no. 548. Exact parallels have been found in Pantikapaion on the Black Sea coast, dated to the second half of the first century CE, and are considered to be eastern Mediterranean products ([[Kunina 1997]], p. 327, nos. 377–378, figs. 180–181).
