## Condition

Intact; small areas with incrustation, especially on the inside; few pinprick bubbles.

## Description

Flaring, in-folded, tubular rim; short, cylindrical neck; squat globular body; slightly concave bottom. Twelve small, pinched projections around widest diameter. No pontil mark on the bottom. There is a thread of the same-colored glass looped along one side of the interior of the mouth and neck, apparently applied by mistake.

## Comments and Comparanda

Squat globular flasks with a row of pinched warts around their greatest diameter are known from several Syro-Palestinian sites ([[Barag 1970a]], vol. 2, plate 43, type 15.33-1; [[Delougaz and Haines 1960]], plate 50, no. 9, from a grave at Khirbat al-Karak, sixth to mid-seventh century CE; [[Harden 1964]], pp. 53–54, fig. 13, top row, no. 5, from Ajlun, sixth to early seventh c.; [[Bauer 1938]], p. 540, no. 87, fig. 28:4, plate 151:a, undecorated example from Jerash; [[Stern 2001]], p. 354, no. 201; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 155, no. 218). Also comparable are pinched vessels with tall and wide neck: [[Barag 1970a]], vol. 2, plate 43, type XV:27-1 (variant); [[Matheson 1980]], p. 111, no. 289; cf. [[Gawlikowska and As’ad 1994]], nos. 34–40, plate III:9–17; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 154, no. 214.
