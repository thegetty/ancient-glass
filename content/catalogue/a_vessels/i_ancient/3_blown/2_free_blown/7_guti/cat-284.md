## Condition

Probably intact; it is possible that the spout is mended. Some calcination and pitting.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; fine cylindrical neck; spherical body; flat bottom. No pontil mark visible on the bottom. On the shoulder a conical spout was formed by puncturing and drawing out the body. From lower body to rim a fine thread, probably originally yellow, is spirally wound seven times.

## Comparanda

This flask can be ascribed to a generic form of globular flasks, very widely distributed in the early first century CE ([[Isings 1957]], p. 16, form 26a), distinguished though by the spout on its shoulder, which is a feature known in larger, mostly bag-shaped vessels of that time, known as guti (see comments on {% cat '2003.381' %}). The vessel is decorated with a thread that was melted flush with the surface, a feature present in both the eastern and western provinces of the Roman Empire in the first century CE ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 22–23, form 6); see comments and parallels for {% cat '2003.270' %}.

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
