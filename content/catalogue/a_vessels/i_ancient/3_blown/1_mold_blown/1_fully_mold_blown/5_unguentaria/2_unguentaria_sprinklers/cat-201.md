## Condition

Severely weathered; repaired with small fills near the rim. The surface is iridescent and pitted.

## Description

The rim is vertical and flattened. On the exterior of the rim and 0.5 cm beneath it, a tooled horizontal ridge marks the transition to a wide, cylindrical neck, which tapers toward the body. Mold-blown, rectangular body; rounded shoulder; rests on a flat bottom.

Identical relief, mold-blown decoration appears on all four sides of the body: at the center of each side there is a six-pointed star. At the upper two corners of the side there are two hardly noticeable reliefs, probably circular blobs, and on the lower two corners triangular reliefs. The relief is not crisp and it is mostly faded. On the bottom is visible a scar of a solid pontil (1.4 × 1 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

This flask belongs to a small group of square mold-blown vessels, apparently made in the eastern Mediterranean, decorated mostly with vegetal motifs; their date remains unclear and they have been ascribed either to the Byzantine (fourth–seventh centuries) or the early Islamic (eighth–ninth centuries) periods: {% cite 'Jenkins 1986' %}, p. 17, nos. 11–12 (no. 11 bears identical decoration), dated between the seventh and ninth centuries CE; {% cite 'Bauer 1938' %}, p. 544, no. 100, plate CXLB, fig. 30, from a Byzantine (fourth–seventh centuries) context; {% cite 'Lane 1937' %}, p. 68, fig. 12.H, from a nonstratified context; {% cite 'Oliver 1980' %}, p. 131, no. 230; {% cite 'Whitehouse 2001a' %}, p. 135, nos. 644–645, dated to the period either between the fifth and seventh centuries or between the ninth and twelfth centuries CE; {% cite 'Goldstein et al. 2005' %}, p. 44, nos. 24–26, dated between the fifth and seventh centuries; {% cite 'Ratković-Bukovčan 2004' %}, p. 94, no. 51.
