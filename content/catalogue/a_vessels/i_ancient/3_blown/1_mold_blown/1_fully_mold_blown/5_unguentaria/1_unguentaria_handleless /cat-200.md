## Condition

Intact; milky crust on some parts.

## Description

In-folded, tubular, horizontal rim; cylindrical neck, tapering toward the body; flat, slightly concave bottom. Body in shape of two young, beardless male faces—boyish, chubby, and with curly hair—arranged back-to-back. One face a little bit lower than the other. Flat bottom. Blown into a bipartite mold of two vertical sections, open at the base. Neck and rim free-blown and tooled. Mold seams concealed in hair at the junction of the heads.

## Comments and Comparanda

Janiform vessels belong to a large group of mold-blown vessels that quite naturalistically depict human heads. The body of the vessel features either a whole head, or the frontal part of two heads placed back-to-back. There are also a few examples that comprise more than two heads forming the body. The vessels of the first and second group are occasionally supplemented with a handle. Most of the examples in general are handleless flasks or unguentaria; some are single-handled cups; and very few are double-handled, close-shaped vessels.

Janiform unguentaria are typically products of the eastern Mediterranean, and are probably from the Syro-Palestinian region, where many of the extant examples are found; they traveled to the western Mediterranean provinces, the Balkans, and the Black Sea. They are dated from the third ([[Isings 1957]], p. 94, form 78b; [[Stern 1995]], p. 203, form A4) to the middle of the fifth century CE ([[Antonaras 2009]], pp. 324–326, form 146 = [[Antonaras 2017]], pp. 163–164; [[Foy 2010b]], pp. 264–266), characterized by heavy cheeks and chin, and accentuated curly hair. Other comparanda include the following ([[Hayes 1975]], p. 50, no. 94, plate 7; [[Auth 1976]], p. 74, no. 74; [[Matheson 1980]], p. 73, no. 191; [[Stern 1995]], pp. 210, 232–238, nos. 149–157; [[Foy 2010b]], pp. 261–266; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 82, no. 82; [[Antonaras 2017]], pp. 163–165, form 146).
