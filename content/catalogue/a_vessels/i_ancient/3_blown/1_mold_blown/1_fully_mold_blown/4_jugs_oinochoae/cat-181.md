## Condition

Intact; some areas iridescent, others covered with incrustation.

## Description

Cracked-off, everted rim; broad, conical neck, tapering toward the body; mold-blown head-shaped body; flat bottom. Body in form of youthful, clean-shaven male head, with straight long hair to the nape of the neck and fringe of twelve vertical locks over the forehead. Large, almond-shaped eyes with pronounced pupils staring toward the upper right; soft eyebrows; straight wide nose; small mouth with full lips; round chin; large ears. Conical base formed of three and a half revolutions of a thick trail. A wishbone strap handle is applied to mid-neck in a large pad, drawn out and up, forming a horizontal part that was tooled into a thumb-rest tab, with acute angle below, and drawn vertically down to the upper part of the head’s back and trailed off down to the base, with decoration of 18 horizontal ribs notched between lower attachment and bottom. The handle and the base are made of a different type of glass, seemingly opaque black glass, possibly dark green. Made in a two-part mold with open base—as evidenced by the plain, rough surface of the undersurface of the body. No pontil mark on the bottom. Vertical mold seam behind the ears incorporated in the hair, visible only on the left side of the vessel.

## Comments and Comparanda

This flask and {% cat '2004.44' %} belong to a well-defined group of head flasks, from a workshop creating products all made of a distinctive cobalt-blue translucent glass ({% cite 'Harden et al. 1987' %}, p. 175, no. 96; {% cite 'Whitehouse 1997b' %}, p. 370; {% cite 'Lightfoot 2020' %}, pp. 83–84). All these flasks present, with small differences, as the head of a clean-shaven youth with large, almond-shaped eyes and well-arranged, flowing locks that are typical of late Roman portraiture. The workshop produced free-, dip mold–, and mold-blown vessels, which all had an applied coil base, and the handles are wishbone-shaped, drawn down from the neck to the body, often pinched ({% cite 'Harden et al. 1987' %}, p. 175, no. 96; {% cite 'Whitehouse 1997b' %}, pp. 367–375; {% cite 'Lightfoot 2020' %}, pp. 83–93).
