## Condition

Severely weathered. Surface bears heavy signs of iridescence and flaking. Dark accretions cover the shoulder and neck. Fragments have been reattached near the shoulder. Small fragments are missing in this area.

## Description

In-folded tubular rim; conical mouth; cylindrical neck. Horizontal shoulder, a bit squeezed on one side, and cylindrical body covered with 18 mold-blown vertical ribs. The vessel stands on a flat bottom, at the center of the bottom an oval (1 × 0.7 cm) pontil mark is visible.

## Comments and Comparanda

Mold-blown cylindrical vessels, mainly jugs, with vertical ribs are known from Syro-Palestinian sites, dated the fourth century, and this fashion continues into the sixth century CE ([[Stern 2001]], pp. 265–266; [[Israeli 2003]], p. 184). For parallels of mold-blown cylindrical vessels finished as jugs, see notes on {% cat '71.AF.83' %}.
