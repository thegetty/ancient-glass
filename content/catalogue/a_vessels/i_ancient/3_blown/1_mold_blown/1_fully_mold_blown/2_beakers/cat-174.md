## Condition

Mended and filled.

## Description

Crack-off, ground rim; conical body; flat bottom.

The body is covered with a mold-blown, raised honeycomb pattern of nine rows of embossed oval cells, framed by a smooth band below the rim and another near the bottom, 1.5 cm wide. On the bottom are two raised concentric circles around a central boss.

## Comparanda

This beaker, on the basis of the body shape, is assigned to a relatively well-represented group of mold-blown conical beakers dated to the first century ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 45–46, form 31; [[Stern 1995]], pp. 103–107, nos. 8–10). A very similar beaker with raised almond-shaped bosses was found in Pompeii ([[Scatozza Höricht 1991]], p. 82, fig. 16c). With regard to the decoration it is comparable with a truncated conical beaker with pronounced shoulder (MCT VIII) with embossed diamond-shaped bosses, which is ascribed to an eastern Mediterranean production area and dated to the middle to second half of the first century CE ([[Stern 1995]], pp. 110–111, no. 12). The decoration is also comparable with a shorter beaker in the Corning Museum of Glass ([[Whitehouse 2001a]], p. 30, no. 497). Marianne Stern ([[Stern 1995]], p. 111) has proposed that these vessels imitate facet-cut gems, being glass imitations of *pocula gemmata*, gold and silver cups decorated with gems ([[Hilgers 1969]], p. 261, s.v. “poculum”).
