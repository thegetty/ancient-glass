## Comparanda

Jars are a common shape in the eastern Mediterranean between the third and seventh centuries, with many forms recorded, mostly with bulbous body, and the cylindrical type is rare ([[Stern 1995]], pp. 150–151). The vessel was probably made in Syria, where purple glass was in fashion during the end of the third and the first half of the fourth centuries ([[Hayes 1975]], p. 82; [[Stern 1995]], p. 147). Parallels include three vessels in the Newark Museum ([[Auth 1976]], p. 218, nos. 443–446). Similar but not identical parallels dated in the fourth century have been published from Greece and Syria ([[Antonaras 2017]], p. 132, form 100; cf. [[Isings 1957]], pp. 159–160, form 130b; cf. also [[Dussart 1998]], p. 92, form ΒVIΙ.2424, fig. 18/14, p. 160, BXI.3211b, plate 48).
