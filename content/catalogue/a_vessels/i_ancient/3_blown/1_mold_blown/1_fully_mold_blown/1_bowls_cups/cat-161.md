## Description

Everted, unworked rim sloping inward; slightly convex cylindrical sides; flat bottom. Below the rim, two raised horizontal ribs and pairs of palm fronds below arranged tip to tip, appearing as a wreath encircling the vessel; below this is a Greek inscription in capital letters: ΚΑΤΑΧΑΙΡΕ ΚΑΙ ΕΥΦΡΑΙΝΟΥ (“rejoice and be merry”). Two more raised ribs and a narrower band of palm fronds pointing to the right decorate the lower part of the body; the two side seams are concealed by vertical palm fronds. On underside of base, one raised concentric circle.

## Comments and Comparanda

On first-century CE cylindrical beakers see comments on [2003.319](#num). There are several published cylindrical beakers with wreaths and inscription ΚΑΤΑΧΑΙΡΕ ΚΑΙ ΕΥΦΡΑΙΝΟΥ. They comprise Harden’s ([[Harden 1935]], pp. 171–173) group Fii, the difference between the groups Fi and Fii being the spelling in the former as ΚΑΤΑΙΧΑΙΡΕ and ΚΑΤΑΧΑΙΡΕ in the latter. For comparanda see [[Harden 1935]], pp. 171–173, group Fii; [[Harden 1944]], pp. 87–88, 292; [[McClellan 1983]], pp. 76–77; [[Stern 1995]], pp. 98–99; [[Stern 2001]], no. 54, pp. 125–126; [[Whitehouse 2001a]], pp. 22–23, nos. 485\[Fi\], 486\[Fii\]; Also, for beakers of the group Fi, i.e., with the variant of the inscription as KATAIXAIRE KAI EYFRAINOY: [[Matheson 1980]], p. 54, no. 135; [[Kunina 1997]], p. 275, no. 115; [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], p. 194, no. 538; [[Lightfoot 2017]], p. 73, no. 150; [[Fitzwilliam 1978]], pp. 31–32, no. 51; [[Young 1949]], p. 85, plates 25:2, 26:2–3; [[Oliver 1980]], p. 69, no. 63; [[Weinberg 1992]], p. 128, no. 102\[Fi or ii = partly preserved\]; [[Stiaffini and Borghetti 1994]], p. 140, no. 425, plate 104.
