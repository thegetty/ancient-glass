## Description

Everted, unworked rim sloping inward; slightly convex cylindrical sides; flat bottom. Below the rim, two raised horizontal ribs and pairs of palm fronds below, arranged tip to tip, appearing as a wreath encircling the vessel; below this is a Greek inscription in capital letters: ΚΑΤΑΧΑΙΡΕ ΚΑΙ ΕΥΦΡΑΙΝΟΥ (katachaire kai euphrainou, “rejoice and be merry”). Two more raised ribs and a narrower band of palm fronds pointing to the right decorate the lower part of the body; the two side seams are concealed by vertical palm fronds. On underside of base, one raised concentric circle.

## Comments and Comparanda

On first-century CE cylindrical beakers, see comments on {% cat '2003.319' %}. There are several published cylindrical beakers with wreaths and the inscription ΚΑΤΑΧΑΙΡΕ ΚΑΙ ΕΥΦΡΑΙΝΟΥ. They constitute Harden’s ({% cite 'Harden 1935' %}, pp. 171–173) group Fii, the difference between the groups Fi and Fii being the spelling in the former of ΚΑΤΑΙΧΑΙΡΕ versus ΚΑΤΑΧΑΙΡΕ in the latter.
