## Condition

Almost fully preserved. Mended; a small part of the rim area is missing. Covered by iridescence.

## Description

The vessel was initially blown in a small, slightly conical mold with 26 vertical ribs. In-folded, tubular, flaring rim; wide, conical mouth; cylindrical neck wider toward the body. A constriction at the transition from the neck to the body forms a diaphragm. The globular body is covered with well-defined, S-shaped mold-blown ribs. The vessel stands on a flat, slightly concave bottom. Annular pontil mark (W. 1.4, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.
