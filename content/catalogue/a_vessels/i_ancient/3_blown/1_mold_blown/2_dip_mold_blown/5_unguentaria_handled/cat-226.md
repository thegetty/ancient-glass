## Condition

Intact; light iridescence on the exterior and incrustation on the interior.

## Description

Fire-polished rim; conical mouth; cylindrical neck; hemispherical body; domed bottom. The upper part of the body near the neck is sunken and smooth, giving a crooked stance to the vessel; below, it is covered with 28 dip mold–blown, vertical ribs. No pontil mark on the bottom. A coil is wound once around the mouth; only half of it is preserved.
