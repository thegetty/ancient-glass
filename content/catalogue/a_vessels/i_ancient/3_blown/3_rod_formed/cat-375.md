## Condition

Intact. Some incrustation on the inside.

## Description

Vessel made of translucent yellow-green glass. The small, circular opening of the inkwell is at the center of a wide horizontal rim. A fold of the glass forms a ridge at the transition to the cylindrical body, which tapers to the base; the bottom is flat and slightly concave. A thick, coil handle starts on the body, forms a small ring, and ends on the ridge. The excess of the coil has been stretched and bent on the handle, forming an almost decorative ridge along its central part. A very fine annular pontil scar (W. 2.1, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.
