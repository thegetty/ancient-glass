## Condition

One handle and small part of the rim are missing and have been filled by a resin(?). A little weathering and some incrustation. Large air bubbles have cracked at three points on the body ribs. Also, an empty/void area is visible just below the surface on the lower part of the body.

## Description

Thick, slightly lopsided rim; long, twisted, tubular body bearing eight ribs; a slight constriction, 1 cm below the rim, forms the short neck. The small, integral disk base is slightly off-center and does not allow the vessel to stand. At the center of the undersurface a straight notch is visible, the result of the manipulation of the base’s disk when the body was pressed on it. A pair of small, curved, coil handles extend from upper body to rim.
