## Condition

The vessel is intact, with no cracks or breaks, and only a few nicks and scratches. Some weathering and some incrustation. Some small areas of iridescence. 

## Description

Vertical, smooth, fire-rounded rim; deep convex body decorated with 79 short, vertical ribs, slightly slanting to the left, quite evenly spaced but not uniform in size. Ribs are visible only on the area near the shoulder of the carinated part of the body, starting 1.5 cm below the rim, and range in size from 1.2 to 2.1 cm in length. In the interior, three grooves 0.1 cm thick are visible: one at the center of the bottom and a pair along the circumference of the bottom.
