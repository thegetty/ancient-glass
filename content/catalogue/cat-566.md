## Condition

Intact. Light iridescent weathering in small areas; many pinprick bubbles.

## Description

A thick, bent coil of translucent dark green glass. Several elongated bubbles are visible in the mass of the object, produced by the stretching of the originally globular mass of glass from which it was shaped. The ends are bent over and pressed to close the circumference. Uneven tooling marks, adjacent to the seam, had previously been interpreted as snake heads, but quite probably they were simply the result of the forming process of the armlet.

The size and weight of this particular object make it quite improbable that it was actually a jewelry piece.

## Comments and Comparanda

The great size and weight of the loop makes its identification as a bracelet dubious. It might had been a weight, almost equal to one Roman and Byzantine pound, i.e., libra, or 325 g ({% cite 'Lafaurie 1993' %}; {% cite 'Morrisson 2002' %}, p. 920-921).
