## Condition

Fragment, broken all around.

## Description

White and turquoise stripes of various widths curving on a dark, translucent purple background. The back of the inlay was scored, while still hot, with parallel and crosshatched grooves that form a loose network of lozenges, probably for better adhesion of the tile to the object in which it was set.
