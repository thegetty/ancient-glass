## Condition

Intact

## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of green glass. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible. The two bands are applied onto this surface. There are three faces rendered with more detail, extending to the bust (possibly with necklaces, but more probably a rendering of the neck with two horizontal lines). The bust is framed by a circular wreath, which is red, and the leaves are green, appearing similar to laurel leaves. The additional plaques are rectangular florets with a central vertical red band flanked by two green bands.
