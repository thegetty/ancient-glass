Most of the outside surface is covered with a marbled brown layer of weathering.

## Description

Fire-polished, partly in-folded, short, conical mouth; cylindrical neck, wider toward the body; ovular body; pushed-in, tubular base-ring; flat bottom. On the bottom an annular pontil mark (W. 1.5, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible. A large strap handle with two vertical grooves is added at mid-body and ends folded underneath the rim.

## Comments and Comparanda
