## Condition

Fully preserved. The vessel has much discoloration, visible especially around the mouth and neck. There are a few minor abrasions, such as nicks and scratches.

## Description

Translucent dark blue ground; white and yellow combed pattern. Inward-sloping rim-disk with tooling marks above; cylindrical neck; right-angled junction with rounded shoulder; ribbed, spherical-ovoid body; convex bottom. Two blue scroll-shaped handles extend from under the mouth to the shoulder.

An unmarvered yellow thread is wound around the rim. A mavered thread (probably the same one) continues, spiraling twice around the neck and twice around the shoulder, then continuing, spiraling seven more times on the central body, alternating with a white thread in a combed pattern. Around the bottom a white thread is wound two times and a yellow once. A finer, white thread appearing near the bottom is the loose end of the thread wound around the body.
