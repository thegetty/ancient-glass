## Condition

Mended; a concealed join at the transition from the neck to the body. Iridescence on the exterior, incrustation on the interior. Pastiche (XRF and visual observation suggest the neck and body are from two different objects).

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; cylindrical neck; globular body; slightly concave bottom. A circular mark of a solid pontil (W. 0.8 cm) at the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

The neck belonged to a taller unguentarium, either tear-shaped (e.g., {% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, p. 24, form 8; {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, p. 149, form 126a) or, more probably, conical ({% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, pp. 151–152, forms 128, 130), forms generally dated to the first and second centuries CE.

The body, which is made of a darker shade of green, belongs to a smaller globular unguentarium, a form that appears already from the early third, becomes popular in the fourth, and survives into the fifth century ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, p. 120, miniature version of form 101; {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, p. 157, form 139).

## Provenance

1979, Edwin A. Lipps, 1922–1988 (Pacific Palisades, California), donated to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 1979.
