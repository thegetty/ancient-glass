## Condition

Intact. Silvery weathering and incrustation.

## Description

Vertical rectangular panel tapering toward the base; uneven flat back; straight sides (top missing); a large hole running horizontally through volute at bottom. Molded decoration on front: a series of two volutes appear on the preserved fragment; the entire bead quite probably comprised three volutes like [cats. 509](/catalogue/cat-509/) and [510](/catalogue/cat-510/), each with a truncated pyramidal spike projecting out at the left; three pairs of wavy lines in relief run vertically down the volutes, with other, finer lines between spikes on left.
