## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of red glass. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible, onto which the two bands are applied. There are three Medusas in a fine white circle set in a dark blue square frame. The additional plaques are three squares filled with four triangular elements facing toward the center: two yellow facing each other and one red and one green facing each other.
