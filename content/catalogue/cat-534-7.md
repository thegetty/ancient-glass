## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of green glass. The base mass is invisible, and in the entire thread hole only one type of glass is visible, which is a dark-colored (possibly blue) glass. There are four female heads with short blue hair, set in a gray, square frame. There are no additional plaques.
