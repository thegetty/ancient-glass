## Comments and Comparanda

Jars are a common shape in the eastern Mediterranean between the third and seventh centuries, with many forms recorded, mostly with bulbous body; the cylindrical type is rare ({% cite 'Stern 1995' %}, pp. 150–151). The vessel was probably made in Syria, where purple glass was in fashion during the end of the third and the first half of the fourth centuries ({% cite 'Hayes 1975' %}, p. 82; {% cite 'Stern 1995' %}, p. 147). Parallels include four vessels in the Newark Museum ({% cite 'Auth 1976' %}, p. 218, nos. 443–446). Similar but not identical parallels dated to the fourth century have been published from Greece and Syria ({% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, p. 132, form 100; cf. {% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 159–160, form 130b; cf. also {% cite 'Dussart 1998' %}, p. 92, form ΒVIΙ.2424, fig. 18/14, p. 160, BXI.3211b, plate 48).
