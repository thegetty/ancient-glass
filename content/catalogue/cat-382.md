## Condition

Probably pastiche: neck belongs to a different, wider vessel. The feet were probably pointed originally.

## Description

Round, vertical rim; cylindrical neck; four-sided body, square in cross section; wedge-shaped feet.

Deeply cut decoration. Horizontal grooves on the upper and lower end of the preserved neck. Deep horizontal groove along the middle of the body. Oblique strokes transect the body diagonally, forming a lozenge-shaped motif. On the corners, short triangular bevels pointing to the shoulder and the feet, leaving a prunt along the central groove. Below the horizontal groove, a deep bevel at the center of each side delineates four pyramidal, wedge-shaped feet.
