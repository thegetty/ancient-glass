## Description

Circular medallion with oval suspension ring on the top. The suspension ring was drawn out of a lump of glass, folded backward over a rod, and reattached when the device was stamped onto the medallion. Circular die. Crisp relief. Back side is smooth and flat.

Stamped, frontal bust of a beardless figure, flanked by an inscription that identifies her as Victory, ΝΙΚΗ, written in capital Greek letters: vertically arranged, on the left side, facing upward, ΝΙ, and on the right, facing downward, ΚΗ. The hair of the figure is quite voluminous and reaches the middle of the neck, where it ends, forming a wide foldover. A wide, triangular, beaded band is visible over the forehead. Large eyes; straight, thick nose; closed mouth. Long, triangular neck rising from the oval, almost angular opening of the dress-chiton. The front edge of the dress has relief decoration.
