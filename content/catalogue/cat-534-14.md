## Description

The upper and lower parts are probably dark green. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible, onto which the two bands are applied. There are three female busts with long hair and necklaces in a dark blue, square field. The additional plaques are three rosettes with eleven petals. At the center is a white circle (possibly a different color that has weathered into white) set in red, surrounded by eleven yellow petals, set in translucent purple. The flower shape is inscribed by a red ring with triangular projections in the interior covering the space between the petals. The whole motif is set in a translucent purple field.
