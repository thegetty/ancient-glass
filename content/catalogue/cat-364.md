## Condition

Heavily weathered, iridescent, and pitted areas on most of it.

## Description

Fire-polished rim, in-folded in a small area; wide, conical mouth; almost horizontal shoulder; pear-shaped body, standing on a concave bottom. The entire vessel is a bit crooked, sagging on one side. Two vertical, six-ribbed strap handles are applied on the shoulder, folded in upon themselves, and attached on the upper part of the mouth to the rim. A thick coil is wound once around the neck at mid-height.

## Comments and Comparanda

The vessel was probably made in third-century CE Syria. The features suggesting that attribution are the sagging, sack-shaped body; the distinctively shaped handles; and the single coil of glass decorating the neck. Quite similar to this amphoriskos is a jar with two handles in the Corning Museum of Glass (62.1.12: {% cite 'Whitehouse 2001a' %}, p. 187, no. 733) and another in the Royal Ontario Museum ({% cite 'Hayes 1975' %}, p. 114, no. 436).
