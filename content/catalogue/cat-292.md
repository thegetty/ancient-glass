## Comments and Comparanda

This vessel appears to be quite rare; the only parallel identical in colors and shape is kept at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh ({% cite 'Oliver 1980' %}, p. 51, no. 36). In general for the shape of the vessel, cf. {% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, form 88b, jugs; {% cite 'Vessberg 1956' %}, p.147, form I.3, β.3.γ, fig. 46:13. Additionally, it can be noted that during the first century CE the use of opaque white glass on translucent blue vessels to form handles and bases or in the shape of purely decorative threads and coils is well represented in the JPGM collection, e.g., kantharos {% cat '84.AF.30' %}, jug {% cat '2003.377' %}, flasks {% cat '2003.418' 'cats. 331' %}–{% cat '2003.415' '332' %}, and amphoriskos {% cat '2003.368' %}. In addition, for amphoriskoi see {% cite 'Stern 2001' %}, p. 70, no. 13; {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, p. 138, form 112, no. 460, where other parallels are cited.
