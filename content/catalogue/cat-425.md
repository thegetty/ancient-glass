## Condition

Pastiche of two different vessels, joined at the bottom of the neck. Exterior partly iridescent; interior covered with incrustation.

## Description

In-folded, flattened, flaring rim; cylindrical neck; sloping shoulder; cylindrical body tapering toward the bottom; slightly concave bottom. Round mark of a solid pontil (W. 1.2 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

The neck and rim part probably belong to a Roman flask, likely conical with long neck, made in Egypt, that can be dated to the late first–second centuries CE ({% cite 'Edgar 1905' %}, plate VIII, no. 32.640; {% cite 'Harden 1936' %}, plate XX, no. 797; {% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, p. 222, no. 347). The body belongs to an Islamic flask ({% cite 'Lamm 1930' %}, plate 3:36; {% cite 'Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001' %}, p. 42, form 17e). {% cat '79.AF.184.6' 'Cat. 424' %} has a quite similar body shape.

## Provenance
