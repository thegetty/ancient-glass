Fragment, broken all around.

## Description

Part of a mosaic inlay with floral motifs. On the preserved fragment, the following are depicted: a central vertical yellow stem with five elongated yellow-in-green leaves; two large, fan-shaped red and white flowers flank the stem; above it are three greenish-yellow stems with light blue and white leaves that probably ended in red, tulip-shaped flowers (cf. {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, no. 647).

On the back side are visible banded red and dark-colored reinforcing patches of glass.
