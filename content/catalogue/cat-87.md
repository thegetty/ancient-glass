## Condition

Body fragment of a vessel, broken all around. The upper surface was polished in modern times; the lower surface, which was left in its original condition, is slightly irregular and pitted.

## Description

The fragment is part of a dish’s flat bottom, which stood on a fine purple base-ring. This mosaic vessel is made of circular sections of composite canes of the following types: (1) The first consists of a thin yellow and thick, transparent bluish layer of glass, wound spirally up to seven times. (2) The second consists of a fine white rod surrounded by a thick purple, a fine white, and another fine purple layer of glass. (3) The third represents a seven-petaled rosette. Petals and the central disk, which are made of a grayish glass, are outlined by a fine white layer.
