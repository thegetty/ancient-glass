## Condition

Single fragment; the sole original edge is rounded.

## Description

An almost flat body fragment. On an almost opaque purple (appearing black) background appear two different florets: (1) a circular one with a red rod set in white and light blue layers; (2) an irregular motif, possibly part of a flower with white central part surrounded in areas by turquoise, yellow, and red features. The decoration is inlaid in the upper surface of the matrix and is not visible on the back side, which is rough and flat.
