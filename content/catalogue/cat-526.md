## Comments and Comparanda

In Mycenaean Greece the use of glass reached its peak between 1400 and 1200 BCE. Glass products were mostly beads—simple and relief ones—almost always of dark blue glass cast in open molds ({% cite 'Haevernick [1960] 1981' %}; {% cite 'Haevernick [1963] 1981' %}; {% cite 'Haevernick [1979] 1981' %}, pp. 71–83, 109–112, 190–193, 440–447; {% cite 'Nightingale 2000' %}, pp. 6–10; {% cite 'Nightingale 2018' %}, pp. 30–60). Relief beads appear either as a plaque with the motif pressed on it, or else entirely in the shape of the depicted motif. The decoration on relief beads consists of floral, faunal, anthropomorphic, and mythological themes, objects, and other abstract motifs. The motifs most widely present are the rosette ({% cat '2003.214.3' 'cats. 511' %}–{% cat '2003.214.4' '512' %}), the lily, the ivy leaf ({% cat '2003.214.8' 'cats. 516' %}–{% cat '2003.214.10' '518' %}, {% cat '2003.214.17' 'cats. 525' %}–{% cat '2004.15.2' '527' %}), and the papyrus flower. Common animal motifs are the single and double argonaut ({% cat '2003.214.5' 'cats. 513' %}–{% cat '2003.214.7' '515' %}, {% cat '2004.15.5' 'cats. 530' %}–{% cat '2004.15.6' '531' %}), the triton shell, and, rarely, the octopus. The most common object motifs are the curl, the volute ({% cat '2004.15.3' 'cats. 528' %}–{% cat '2004.15.5' '530' %}), the wave or bracket ({% cat '2003.214.1' 'cats. 509' %}–{% cat '2003.214.2' '510' %}, {% cat '2004.15.7' '532' %}), the circular ornament, the figure-of-eight shield ({% cat '2003.214.11' 'cats. 519' %}–{% cat '2003.214.16' '524' %}), a libation jug, and the bi-concave altar. Motifs of human and/or mythical figures include the sphinx, the Minoan/Mycenaean Genius, and the woman in formal Minoan/Mycenaean dress ({% cite 'Nightingale 2018' %}, p. 36).

Molds have been unearthed in and around palaces, indicating centralized production of these items. In addition to beads (but only seldom), other objects, such as seals, sword hilts, gaming pieces, and pins, were made of glass. Although many of the beads have two holes and thus would have served as spacer-beads holding together several strings of beads, in the Mycenaean period they were strung together to form necklaces, sewn on garments, or even used as diadems.
