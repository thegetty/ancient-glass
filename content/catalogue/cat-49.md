## Condition

Intact. Some light weathering on the shoulders and on the base.

## Description

Translucent dark blue ground; opaque yellow and turquoise décor. Narrow trefoil rim-disk; short, cylindrical neck; convex shoulder; ovoid body; convex bottom. Short outward-splayed base, concave on its underside, a bit off-center. An opaque light blue strap handle extends from the shoulder to the rim-disk.

An unmarvered yellow thread is wound around the rim. A marvered yellow thread is wound three times in horizontal lines on the shoulder, and below, together with a turquoise thread, wound three–four times and dragged up and down, forming a zigzag pattern. Below this a marvered yellow thread is wound spirally twice.
