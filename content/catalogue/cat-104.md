## Condition

Fragment.

## Description

Flat fragment of what was probably the bottom of a wide bowl or plate. On the back side, a curved scar indicates the trail of the base-ring, which was probably a translucent purple rod that was removed when the fragment was repolished, probably in modern times. The vessel was made of florets of two types: (1) a central yellow rod surrounded by six yellow rods set in translucent purple, set in red; (2) a central rod comprising rolled white and transparent yellowish layers surrounded by seven red rods set in translucent purple, outlined by a white layer. The same motif appears on both sides of the vessel.
