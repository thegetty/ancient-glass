## Description

The bowl has a flaring lip; conical, cyma recta body; and flat bottom. It stands on a tall, circular base-ring formed by a single revolution of an applied coil of glass.

The vessel is made of discoid mosaic tesserae, with florets of the following types: (1) a central red rod surrounded by a layer of translucent green with ten yellow rods in it; (2) a central red rod surrounded by a spiraling layer of almost two revolutions of trapezoidal translucent green compartments outlined in yellow, which is surrounded in turn by a purple layer. The coil of the base is ribbon mosaic comprising parallel layers of yellow and greenish glass.
