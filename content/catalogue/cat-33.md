## Condition

Fully preserved; some cracks are visible; surface pitted and in areas discolored. The surface has some abrasions and nicks. White-yellow sand from the core is still visible on the interior.

## Description

Blue ground, now opaque; opaque white decoration. Broad, horizontal rim-disk; cylindrical neck; straight-sided piriform body that turns abruptly inward and downward to a convex bottom. Two lugs near the neck.

A marvered white thread is wound 17 times around the body, from the bottom to the rim. At the upper part of the body, below the lugs and down to the carination, nine coils of the thread are combed, forming upright festoons.

## Comments and Comparanda

On core-formed alabastra of this period, see comments on {% cat '2003.194' %}. For the classification of this particular alabastron, see {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, class III:E, alabastron form III:5. The majority of the alabastra of this form are better proportioned and quite similar among themselves, quite different to the squatter variant of this vessel, which is very similar to an example from Amathous, Cyprus ({% cite 'Harden 1981' %}, p. 128, no. 340).

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
