Single fragment.

## Description

The same pattern appears on both sides. Could be the body of a fish or eel. Rectangular piece, cut in this shape in antiquity. Along the upper edge a translucent olive-green band. Along the lower edge an applied opaque red band. The body is made of rows of florets, each of them composed of a red central rod set in green and yellow layers, on a green background, giving the impression of fish scales.
