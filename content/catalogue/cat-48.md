## Condition

Mild pitting. A burst bubble on the lower part of the handle. Tooling marks on the upper surface of the base. Whitish remains of the core in the interior.

## Description:

Core-formed, opaque white oinochoe decorated with translucent purple threads. Trefoil rim-disk; short, cylindrical neck; sloping shoulder; ovoid body; convex bottom; discoid conical base. Tall, strap handle, arching well above the rim-disk, applied on the shoulder and attached on the rim.

One unmarvered thread around the rim and the base. A marvered thread is wound eight times from neck to mid-body. The last four coils, on the wider part of the body, are dragged up and down, forming a zigzag pattern; the last three coils are adjacent, appearing as one wide thread. Just below the zigzag pattern, another purple thread is wound twice around.

## Comments and Comparanda

The oinochoiske (juglet) was one of the ceramic vessel forms that had been rendered in glass with core-forming since the sixth century BCE, when this technique, known in Mesopotamia and Egypt since the middle of the second millennium BCE, was introduced in the Aegean world. In addition to oinochoiskai, amphoriskoi (small amphorae), alabastra, and aryballoi were imitated in core-formed glass. It is believed that they functioned as unguentaria, intended for aromatic and cosmetic substances ({% cite 'Harden 1981' %}; {% cite 'McClellan 1984' %}; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 109–125; {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 37–44).

This object belongs to the earliest group of Aegean core-formed vessels, dating from the middle of the sixth century to the end of the fifth century BCE ({% cite 'Harden 1981' %}, pp. 58–99; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 110–115), made either of blue glass and decorated with white, yellow, and turquoise threads or of milky white glass decorated with purple threads. Vessels of this group have been found in great numbers in Rhodes, Macedonia, the Aegean islands, and Italy. For the classification of this particular oinochoe, see {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, class I:A, oinochoe form I:2: pp. 148–149, nos. 110–113.
