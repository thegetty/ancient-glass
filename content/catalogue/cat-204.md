## Condition

Intact. Whitish weathering, especially present in the depths of the cells.

## Description

In-folded, tubular, flaring rim; wide, short, cylindrical neck, constricted at its base to create a diaphragm; spherical body; convex bottom. Neck and rim are free-blown. The mold-blown body is covered with a network of rows of lozenges. The cells are quite uniform in most parts of the body, but along the seam of the mold they are irregular. The mold consisted of two vertical parts, and the vertical seam is visible on the body.
