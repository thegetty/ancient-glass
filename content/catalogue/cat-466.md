## Condition

Single fragment preserves one straight edge of the original band.

## Description

Small fragment with part of a flower, probably quatrefoil, with white petals outlined in red. Yellow parts are visible in the cross section that, given the current state of the band, are not discernible on the surface. On the back side behind the flower is an opaque off-white patch.
