## Condition

Single fragment; two of the original, rounded edges preserved.

## Description

Wide, wavy bands of red and light green divided by three fine dark green lines and white glass. On one edge of this band a short, bending, applied, red feature is preserved.

## Comments and Comparanda

Possibly part of a maritime presentation, part of the body of a fish. Probably from the same object as {% cat '76.AF.70.16' %}, although that piece is thicker (Th. 0.5 cm). For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire, see comments on {% cat '2003.260' 'cats. 449' %} and {% cat '2004.26.2' '460' %}. For maritime motifs on incrustations, see comments on {% cat '2003.266' %}.

## Provenance

By 1976, Bruce McNall, donated to the J.Â Paul Getty Museum, 1976
