## Condition

Intact

## Description

### COLORS OF UPPER AND LOWER PARTS

Red

### BASE MASS

None. At the lower, wider opening the hole is red at least to mid-height. On the upper hole is visible an interior gray layer—the same as the one into which the face masks are applied—covered by a red layer.

### FACES: NUMBER AND OUTLINE

Two almost square faces. A thin purple layer around the head, set in a wide gray square field.

### ADDITIONAL PLAQUES 

Two oval features flank the faces. In the center is a rectangular banded bit, with red, white, yellow, and translucent green and blue set in an oval light green. The pattern on the central bit is not understandable but is probably part of a larger motif. The second oval has only a small part of a red and white pattern at the edge, possibly the same with the other one.
