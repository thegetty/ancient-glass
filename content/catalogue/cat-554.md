## Comments and Comparanda

For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire, see {% cat '2003.260' %}. The pendant could also belong to a much later production with parallels in the shape of mosaic beads from burials in Cheremshansky, Samara region, dated to the Khazarian period, in the second half of the eighth–first half of the ninth century CE; see {% cite 'Stashenkov 2015' %}, fig. 8.
