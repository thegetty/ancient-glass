## Condition

Mended and filled in some areas of the rim. There are two perforations (diam. 0.2 cm) at 0.4 cm below the rim, placed across from each other. In the perforations, layers of white weathering are visible.

## Description

Ground vertical rim; hemispherical bowl; flat bottom. The bowl is made of a disk formed from a single composite cane of glass which consists in turn of three wide layers, one a translucent amber-color and two purple, each flanked by a thin layer of opaque white glass. The cane was bent at least 12 times, creating the illusion of veins in agate.

## Comments and Comparanda

Agate was one of the favorite stones of the Romans, and its rich colors and intricate veins of different colors were rendered in glass in Hellenistic and Roman times ({% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 192–193, 247–249; {% cite 'Weinberg and McClellan 1992' %}, pp. 56–58, 97–98). Agate glass vessels are known in several shapes: shallow bowls like this vessel ({% cite 'Platz-Horster 1992' %}, p. 303, no. 166), deeper bowls ({% cite 'Azuma 2001' %}, no. 127), bottles ({% cite 'Fossing 1940' %}, p. 114, fig. 860), and spindle-shaped alabastra ({% cite 'Auth 1976' %}, p. 53, no. 43; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, p. 369, no. 668; {% cite 'Schlick-Nolte 2002' %}, pp. 88–90, V-47). They are ascribed to Italian workshops, especially in Rome. For a gold-band plate, see {% cite 'Alekseeva and Sorokina 2007' %}, pp. 54–57, figs. 7–8, plate 37:1–2.

In addition, many ribbed bowls were formed with marbled mosaic glass that was a rendition of agate with opaque white wavy veins in a dark-colored translucent matrix, often dark blue or purple, for example {% cat '72.AF.37' %} ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 19–20, form 3b; {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, pp. 54–56, form 6b).
