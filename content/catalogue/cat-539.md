## Description

A spherical bead made of six rows of florets from five composite mosaic canes. These slices were fused together as a flat mass and subsequently folded around a rod and rolled. The seam of this folding is still visible along the edge of the hole in the bead. Each floret consists of a central green rod set in turn in yellow and red and then in a layer comprising 14 petals alternately dark green (appearing black) and white.
