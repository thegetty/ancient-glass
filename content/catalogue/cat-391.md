## Condition

Pastiche. Neck is part of another vessel, quite probably a modern amendment. The body and the neck are iridescent and partly covered by weathering and incrustation on the exterior and interior. Cracks visible on the body.

## Description

Round rim; cylindrical neck. Four-sided body, square cross section; flat bottom. The neck is wider than the opening on the body and gives the impression of a diaphragm. A scar of a solid pontil mark (W. 0.8 cm) is visible on the bottom.
