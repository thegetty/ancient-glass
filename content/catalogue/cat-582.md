## Condition

Mended. Broken spout; iridescent from weathering, and large areas with whitish crust.

## Description

Fire-polished, rounded rim; slightly flaring upper part; cylindrical body tapering toward the convex bottom, with the scar of a solid pontil (W. 1.5 cm) at its center. An applied spout at the upper part of the body appears to be a continuous mass of glass internally. The spout was curved toward the bottom of the bowl.
