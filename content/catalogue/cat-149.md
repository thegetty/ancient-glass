Mended. Exterior covered with whitish iridescent weathering; interior covered with weathering and soil crust.

## Description

Flaring, flattened rim; cylindrical neck, tapering toward the bulbous body; flat bottom. The vessel consists of apporximately 18 amber-colored and white rods, which were fused together, slumped, and blown to form the closed shape of the vessel and then “combed” 11 times, forming a distinct zigzag pattern. Rotary marks are visible in the interior of the neck.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the production technique, see comments on {% cat '2003.277' %}.

This type of squat flask is well-known and has been unearthed in different parts of the Roman Empire, mainly in the western areas and Italy, which is considered to be their production site ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 22–23, form 6; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 261–262, 339–340, no. 609). The decoration of these glass vessels imitated vessels carved from semiprecious stone, especially sardonyx. Published examples include finds from Aquileia ({% cite 'Calvi 1968' %}, plate 5, nos. 1–3), Athens ({% cite 'Alexandri 1972' %}, pp. 115–118, plate 76), Zadar ({% cite 'Ravagnan 1994' %}, p. 67, no. 105), and Bahrain ({% cite 'Nenna 1999b' %}, p. 188, no. 280). In addition, several examples are in museum collections: the Louvre ({% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005' %}, pp. 74–75, nos. 91, 94–95, 97, probably from Italy); National Museum of Scotland ({% cite 'Lightfoot 2007' %}, p. 48, nos. 46–47); Fitzwilliam Museum ({% cite 'Fitzwilliam 1978' %}, p. 25, no. 38); Miho Museum ({% cite 'Miho Museum 2001' %}, pp. 95, 203, no. 127); and previously in the Winfield Smith Collection ({% cite '*Glass from the Ancient World* 1957' %}, p. 89, no. 149). The same shape has been rendered in gold-band mosaic glass as well (see {% cite 'Oliver 1967' %}, p. 23, no. 3, fig. 17; {% cite 'Kunina 1997' %}, p. 268, no. 95), and in a mosaic pattern that may be an example of blown mosaic vessels ({% cite '*Glass from the Ancient World* 1957' %}, p. 85, no. 141).
