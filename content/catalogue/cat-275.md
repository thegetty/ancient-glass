## Condition

Intact; iridescent layer of weathering on the inside.

## Description

Fire-polished, rounded, flaring rim; conical mouth; cylindrical neck, widening toward the body; conical body with rounded carination that curves in toward the tubular, folded base-ring. A fine thread of greenish glass is wound spirally five times on the lower part of the neck. A circular scar (W. 0.9 cm) of a solid pontil is visible on the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

Flasks with similar carinated bodies are known in variants, usually standing on a base-ring and very often decorated with a simple, fine thread wound around the neck. At least some of them are considered products of Cyprus ({% cite 'Vessberg 1952' %}, p. 135, flask type B.I, plate VIII:1–2), and they are found mainly in eastern Mediterranean sites, dated to the second–third centuries CE ({% cite 'Hayes 1975' %}, p. 67, no. 201, fig. 6, plate 15, without base-ring; {% cite 'Spartz 1967' %}, nos. 85–86, plate 19; {% cite 'Auth 1976' %}, p. 124, no. 154; {% cite 'Kunina 1997' %}, p. 299, no. 224; {% cite 'Whitehouse 2001a' %}, p. 166, no. 695; {% cite 'Stern 2001' %}, pp. 148, 212–213, no. 102, without base; {% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, p. 173, no. 226).
