## Condition

Mended. Pitting on the surface, more visible on the decoration; weathering on the ground areas.

## Description

Translucent dark blue ground; white and yellow décor. Flat, horizontal rim; cylindrical neck; oval body; pointed bottom on a tall, conical, outward-splayed base. On the shoulders are two dark blue horizontal loop handles.

A marvered white thread spirally wound four times on the lower part of the neck continues with eight revolutions on the upper part of the body, where it is flanked by five coils of a yellow thread, and ends with five more coils on the lower body. The decoration on the upper body is dragged upward, forming a zigzag pattern. This tooling resulted in vertical ribbing on the body.

## Comments and Comparanda

Double-handled unguentaria along with hydriskai, jars, and lentoid aryballoi are a new vessel form, ascribed to the second, far rarer group II of Mediterranean core-formed vessels. This group appears late in the fourth century BCE, at the very beginning of the Hellenistic era (fourth–first centuries BCE), and dominated the market until the first or second quarter of the third century. New production centers operated then, probably in Italy and mainland Greece, possibly Macedonia. New decorative patterns replaced the old zigzags with festoons and feather patterns ({% cite 'Harden 1981' %}, pp. 100–121; {% cite 'McClellan 1984' %}, pp. 77–126; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 115–122; {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 38–39).
