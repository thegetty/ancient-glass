## Description

Part of the bottom of a bowl. A gold-glass-trail inscription in two rows divided by a line: INNO / CENTI; set in a rectangular frame with a straight, fine line and a folded exterior one.

## Comments and Comparanda

This is a replica imitating a special group of glass vessels with an inscription in gold placed between two layers of transparent glass, in the gilt-glass-trail technique. On the taste for copies of late Roman gold-glass vessels in the late nineteenth century, see comments on {% cat '2003.296' %}. In a rectangular, often colored—for example, blue or red—frame, a generic “cheers” phrase was written in two lines, such as ANNI / BONI, etc. They are dated in the second half of the third century CE and are products of a western, probably Italian workshop.
