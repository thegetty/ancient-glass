## Condition

Single fragment. Possibly one curved edge from the original piece.

## Description

Indiscernible motif on an olive-green background. Along the curved edge is a light blue and a green band. Two individual motifs are partly preserved. One, which is closer to the outer edge, consists of dark purple (seemingly black) concentric ovals in red, white, and black layers; over and adjacent to this shape, red and purplish features. The second consists of concentric ovals with a central green set in yellow, in red, and in green; adjacent is a turquoise blob on the one side and an elongated red and purplish one on the other.

On the back side bands are visible, and on the main part the olive-green background is visible.
