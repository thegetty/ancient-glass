## Condition

One handle restored. Some minor nicks and scratches. One side of the vessel is discolored and iridescent.

## Description

Translucent dark green (appearing black) body; opaque white and turquoise decoration. Broad, inward-sloping rim-disk; relatively tall, cylindrical neck; obtuse-angled shoulder; top-shaped body; convex bottom; circular base-knob with a rounded edge. Two dark green vertical strap handles extend from the upper part of the neck to the shoulders.

An unmarvered opaque white thread is wound around the rim. A marvered white thread starts on the shoulder and spirals five times around the shoulders and the upper body, where a marvered opaque turquoise thread is wound twice, and they are both tooled into a zigzag pattern to the middle of the body. Below this a marvered white thread is wound horizontally twice around the body.
