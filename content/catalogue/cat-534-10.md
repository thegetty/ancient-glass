## Condition

Intact

## Description

### COLORS OF UPPER AND LOWER PARTS

Red

### BASE MASS

Probably none. In the hole it appears to be black, probably the back side of the mosaic sections. The two bands appear olive-green in some areas, covered with a thin layer of opaque red glass. Probably they are a red that has deteriorated and weathered to green.

### FACES: NUMBER AND OUTLINE

Three faces, each with blue, thin hair all around it, or hairless. In a fine blue frame outlined in white set in a wide, square blue field.

### ADDITIONAL PLAQUES 

Plaque with a red band flanked by two yellow bands.
