## Condition

Intact

## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of red glass. There is probably no base mass, and in the thread hole it appears to be black, probably the back side of the mosaic sections. The two bands appear olive-green in some areas, covered with a thin layer of opaque red glass, probably a red that has deteriorated and weathered to green. There are three faces, each surrounded by blue, thin hair, or hairless. They are enclosed in a fine blue frame outlined in white, set in a wide, square blue field. There is an additional plaque with a red band flanked by two yellow bands.
