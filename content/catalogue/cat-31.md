## Condition

The vessel is almost completely iridescent, with a small area of the original blue color still visible. There are some minor abrasions, such as a small hole near the bottom, and some nicks and scratches.

## Description

Translucent dark blue ground; opaque yellow, now appearing white, decoration. Broad, horizontal rim-disk; biconical body; convex bottom. Two lugs near the neck.

A yellow, now appearing white, thread is wound 33 times around the body from the bottom to the rim. The thread is combed at the upper part of the body from under the rim to the transition to the lower conical part, forming a feathered pattern.
