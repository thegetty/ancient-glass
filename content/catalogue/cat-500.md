## Condition

Fragment; part of one edge is preserved.

## Description

Part of the representation of a fish. Rows of greenish and blue semicircular motifs, representing fish scales, outlined with a white straight band, probably the outline of the body, below which are obliquely arranged red and green sections on a dark blue background, probably a fin. On the back side, the motifs are clearly visible, undistorted.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire, see comments on {% cat '2003.260' 'cats. 449' %} and {% cat '2004.26.2' '460' %}. On glass panels and vessels with mosaic fish motifs, see comments and parallels cited for {% cat '2003.266' %}.

In the rendering of the scales, the colors of the fins, and even the white outline of the body, this vessel is connected directly with fragments in the Corning Museum of Glass ({% cite 'Goldstein 1979' %}, p. 265, no. 794, plate 35; {% cite 'Harden et al. 1987' %}, p. 31, no. 9, 61.1.6: <https://glasscollection.cmog.org/objects/6202>) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art (10.130.2692: <https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/570436>; 26.7.1199: <https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551563>).
