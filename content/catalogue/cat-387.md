## Condition

Probably pastiche. Neck probably belongs to a different vessel. One of the feet is partly missing and restored with resin. The feet were probably pointed originally.

## Description

Round, vertical rim; conical neck; four-sided body, square in cross section; wedge-shaped feet.

Deeply cut decoration. Short bevel on the upper corners, leaving a prunt on the shoulder. Below this prunt is a longer bevel which ends, leaving a small prunt that delineates the body. Below that is a horizontal stroke, which, in combination with a deep bevel at the center of each side, delineates four pyramidal, wedge-shaped feet.
