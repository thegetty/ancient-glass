## Condition

Fully preserved. Covered with greenish weathering.

## Description

Head facing forward. All facial features are rendered but not very crisply. Accentuated eyebrows; almond-shaped, oval eyes; smooth cheeks; heavy lips; large ears; long neck terminating in a flat end. Upper and lower ends are flat and smooth, and sides are tapered toward the back side, which is smooth and flat.

## Comments and Comparanda

On Pharaonic Egyptian glass inlays in general, see comments on {% cat '2003.149' %}. Frontal depiction of the face is quite rare in Egyptian art, mostly used as a hieroglyph with the sound value *ḥr* (meaning “on, around, over, for”). This piece is small and may have been used in an inlaid band of inscriptions in a miniature shrine, or may have been the inlaid face of an ushabti figurine (on glass in statuettes in general, see {% cite 'Cooney 1960' %}, pp. 21–29, fig. 19).

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his daughter, Ingrid Reisser, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
