## Condition

Intact. Iridescence and on small areas a white layer of weathering.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; tall, cylindrical body tapering toward the pushed-in, conical base; concave bottom. The body and the base are covered with twisted dip mold–blown ribs. An annular pontil mark (W. 2.2, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

This particular shape of beaker is quite rare if not unique among dip mold–blown vessels, that is, vessels which were first blown in a small and shallow mold and then further expanded by free-blowing. For a similar body shape with different base shape, see {% cite 'Whitehouse 2001a' %}, p. 147, no. 661. Spirally winding trails around the body were also used to give a very similar appearance to beakers, such as {% cite 'Vessberg 1952' %}, p. 123, B.II.β, plate IV:11.

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
