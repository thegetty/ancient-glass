## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of green glass. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible. The two bands are applied onto this surface. In the thread hole, it can be seen that the green bands were added onto the finished central band; part of the back side of the floral floret is visible. There are three faces with short dark blue hair, set in a lighter blue square frame. The additional plaques are two square tiles. In each one are placed four trilobe leaves, green outlined in yellow facing outward, the upper two downward and the lower two upward, forming a lozenge-like void area in the center of the tile. They are set in one blue and one red layer of glass.
