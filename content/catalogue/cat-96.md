## Condition

Single body fragment.

## Description

Rectangular piece of a mildly curved part of a vessel, probably the transition from the bottom to the body, as the reducing thickness toward the curved part indicates. It consists of two types of rectangular tesserae: (1) eight-petaled
green rosette outlined in yellow, set in red; (2) eight-petaled blue rosette outlined in white, set in blue. On the back side, irregularly arranged, are the same two types of tesserae.
