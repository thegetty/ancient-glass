## Condition

Intact; a small chip missing from the bottom. Heavy weathering, especially on the inside, and iridescence on the exterior.

## Description

Fire-polished, rounded rim; conical neck, constricted at its base; pear-shaped body; slightly raised base-ring; flat bottom. Slightly lopsided neck. The body is covered with a mold-blown honeycomb pattern of six horizontal rows of hexagonal cells. Blown on a three-part mold with two vertical parts and one for the base, with a slightly raised circle at the periphery of the bottom rendering a ring-base.

## Comments and Comparanda

Mold-blown and dip mold–blown glass vessels are present in various periods of Islamic glassware ({% cite 'Whitehouse 2001c' %}, pp. 81–83). The honeycomb pattern appears in Islamic glassware on jugs, juglets, bowls, and jars in the tenth–eleventh centuries (e.g., {% cite 'Brosh 2003' %}, pp. 356–357, nos. 479–482) and in the twelfth–thirteenth centuries (e.g., {% cite 'Whitehouse 2014' %}, pp. 97–102, nos. 771–782). Some of them were probably made in Iran ({% cite 'von Saldern 1974' %}, pp. 194, 197–199, 204, nos. 290–291, 293–294, 296, 306; {% cite 'Carboni and Whitehouse 2001' %}, pp. 98–99, nos. 24–25).

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
