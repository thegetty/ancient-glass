## Condition

Body fragment of a vessel, broken all around. The exterior is polished, probably in modern times. The interior is slightly dull and affected by weathering, particularly the opaque glass.

## Description

The piece consists of polygonal tesserae fused together. Each tessera comprises a central red rod surrounded by eight yellow petals outlined in translucent purple. Each flower is set in a wide, translucent dark blue layer of glass.
