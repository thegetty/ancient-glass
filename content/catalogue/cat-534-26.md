## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of green glass. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible. The two bands are applied onto this surface. There are three faces, each set in a round white and a square blue frame. The additional plaques are three square tiles; in each one, set in translucent dark blue field, there are two yellow, one green, and one red triangles, all facing toward the center.
