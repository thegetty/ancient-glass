## Description

None. The back side of the mosaic sections is visible. In the hole the bands appear to have been added onto the central band, which is dark-colored.

### FACES: NUMBER AND OUTLINE

Three Medusas. In purple, rectangular outline. At the center of outline’s lower edge is a yellow square. The upper white coil is not perfectly closed.

Banded rectangular elements. The one that is not deformed presents a succession of a green, a red, a yellow, a very thin red, and a yellow band.
