Intact

## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of white glass. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible. In the thread hole, the bands appear to have been added onto the central band, which is dark colored. There are three Medusas, in a purple, rectangular outline. At the center of outlineâ€™s lower edge is a yellow square. The upper white coil is not perfectly closed. The additional plaques are banded rectangular elements. The one that is not deformed presents a succession of a green, a red, a yellow, a very thin red, and a yellow band.
