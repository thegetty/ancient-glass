## Condition

Single rim and upper body fragment.

## Description

The vessel, apparently a deep bowl, has a vertical rim with lip ground both inside and outside, and conical body. Two horizontal ridges form a depressed band 0.5 cm below the rim on part of the fragment—probably a tooling mark and not a decorative feature. The preserved part of the vessel is made of rectangular mosaic tesserae, with florets of two types: (1) a large quatrefoil of consecutive layers of yellow in green, white, and red, set in a thick dark blue ground, quite probably rendering a four-petaled flower; (2) smaller quatrefoils of green petals set in yellow, which are set in greenish ground.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the production technique, see {% cite 'Dawes 2002' %} and comments on {% cat '85.AF.85' %}. For closer parallels, see {% cat '76.AF.70.44' %}. The tesserae depicting the larger, four-petaled flower appear often in plaques with Egyptianizing floral motifs, such as {% cat '2004.26.2' %}. On the trade of small fragments of mosaic glass in the nineteenth century and on the different techniques and classes of mosaic glass present in the Getty collection, see comments on {% cat '76.AF.70.21' %}.

A fragment, probably part of the rim of an open-shape vessel, with identical motif is in the Freer Gallery (F. 1909.512.3.6; {% cite 'Liu 2008' %}, p. 64, lower photo; https://asia.si.edu/object/F1909.512/#object-content), originally bought from J. Dattari, an antiquarian and antiquities dealer from Cairo.
