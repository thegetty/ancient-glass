## Condition

Fully preserved; part of the thread is missing.

## Description

In-folded, tubular, flaring rim; conical mouth; short, cylindrical neck, wider toward the globular body, which stands on a tubular, pushed-in base-ring. No sign of a pontil mark on the bottom. A fine thread is wound spirally 13 times around the body and stops at the transition to the base. Two coil handles are placed on the shoulders, over the white thread; they bend, forming an open ring, and end on the lower neck.

## Comments and Comparanda

Free-blown, small globular and bulbous flasks for oils, occasionally supplemented with small handles ({% cite 'Calvi 1969' %}, plate 1:4; {% cite 'Mandruzzato and Marcante 2007' %}, p. 76, no. 122), appeared in the early first century CE and soon became one of the most widespread forms of flask throughout the Roman Empire ({% cite 'Stern 1977' %}, p. 35; {% cite 'De Tommaso 1990' %}, pp. 39–40, type 5). They were often decorated with spirally wound threads, usually left unmarvered ({% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, p. 146, form 122a, wherein several parallels are cited). For additional parallels, see comments on {% cat '2003.420' %}.
