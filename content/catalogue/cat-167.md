## Condition

Mended. Minor chipping on the rim, filled.

## Description

Flaring rim, with unworked, slightly everted lip; short and wide neck; calyx-shaped body; and flat bottom, with three concentric raised circles around a central recessed knob. An inscription in capital Greek runs around the vessel at greatest diameter in a frieze flanked by three ridges above and two below. It reads: ΕΥΦΡΑΙΝΟΥ ΕΦΩ ΠΑΡΕΙ, *euphrainou epho parei* (“rejoice with what you are present in”). A frieze of 35 upturned tongues in raised outline covers the lower part of the body.

## Comments and Comparanda

There are two variants of this type of vessel distinguished by the contour of the walls and the relation of the height to the diameter. This one belongs to the taller, slender variant with three ridges above the inscription ({% cite 'Harden 1935' %}, group G1ii). See {% cat '95.AF.60' %}.
