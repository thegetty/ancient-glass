## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of red glass. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible. In the thread hole, the red bands appear to have been added onto the central band, which is a dark-colored green. There are two hairless faces with open mouths, outlined in a light blue, planoconvex frame that is straight on the upper part and curved on the lower part and sides. The additional plaques are two four-petaled rosettes. A central white square is set in red, surrounded by four wedge-shaped, white petals set in translucent green, surrounded by four outer, red wavy petals set in a round blue matrix.
