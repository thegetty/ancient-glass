## Description

The bowl has a flaring lip; conical, cyma recta body; and flat bottom. It stands on a tall, circular ring-base formed by a single revolution of an applied coil of glass.

The vessel is made of: (1) lengths of blue and white, single-colored canes; (2) composite canes—a fine yellow flanked by two thick green canes, a fine white flanked by two thick purple canes; and (3) a few twisted canes—purple ground with a fine white thread, and a colorless ground with a fine yellow thread.

The coil of the base is ribbon mosaic comprising wavy but parallel layers of green, white, and yellow glass.
