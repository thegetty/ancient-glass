## Condition

Almost fully preserved; neck is mended, and part of one handle is missing. In the interior, visible light-colored remains of the core.

## Description

Transluecent dark blue ground with opaque turquoise and yellow decoration. Moderately broad, horizontal rim-disk, uneven and sloping inward; short, cylindrical neck; horizontal shoulder; ovular body; convex bottom. Below the shoulder two opposing yellow ring handles with knobbed tails.

An unmarvered opaque yellow thread is wound around the rim. A marvered opaque yellow thread is spirally wound five times in almost horizontal lines around the upper body above the handles. Below is another yellow thread wound twice at the middle of the handles. At central and lower body, a thick turquoise and a fine yellow thread are spirally wound five and nine times respectively, and are dragged upward and downward alternately 30 times, forming a zigzag pattern. Below this band, near the bottom, a yellow and a turquoise thread are each wound once. The central part of the body is ribbed by the tooling that formed the zigzag pattern.
