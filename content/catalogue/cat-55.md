## Condition

Intact.

## Description

Translucent dark blue ground; yellow and turquoise decoration. Broad, inward-sloping turquoise rim-disk; cylindrical neck; convex shoulder; ovoid body; convex pointed bottom. Two “dolphin” ring handles with knobbed tails, one dark blue and one yellow, extend from the middle of the neck to the shoulder.

An unmarvered dark blue thread is wound around the rim. A marvered yellow thread is wound five times around the body as horizontal lines and at the largest diameter a turquoise thread is added, spiraling three times with the yellow thread, dragged to form a zigzag and feathered pattern. Below are two yellow threads flanking a turquoise thread. At the center of the bottom is a wider turquoise dot with a smaller yellow dot at the center.
