## Description

The necklace consists of 29 irregular globular mosaic face beads and one face pendant. Around the central part of each bead are mosaic florets representing female faces that in most cases alternate with florets with geometrical patterns, arranged in a band. This central band is framed on top and bottom with a wide colored band of glass. Beads 1–4, 8–15, 18–19, 21–28, and 30 have a vertical thread hole that tapers slightly upward. Beads 5–7, 17, 20, and 29 have a vertical thread hole that tapers slightly downward.
