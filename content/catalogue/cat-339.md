## Comments and Comparanda

This unguentarium belongs to one of the most common groups and was widely distributed all over the Mediterranean region during the first and early second centuries CE; see {% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, p. 24, form 8; {% cite 'Vessberg 1952' %}, plate IX:17; {% cite 'Barag 1970a' %}, vol. 2, plate 44, type XVI:2; {% cite 'Nicolaou 1984' %}, p. 245, no. 184, plate LIII:184; {% cite 'De Tommaso 1990' %}, pp. 84–85, types 70–72; {% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, pp. 214–215, nos. 325–328. They are very often found in burials, both inhumations and cremations. Those that were placed in the burial pyre, like this vessel, are heavily distorted.
