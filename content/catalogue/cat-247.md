## Comments and Comparanda

Acquired with the beaker {% cat '2003.379.1' %}. The shape of the vessel and its rim permit us to hypothesize that it was used as a liner for a metal lamp. There are known parallels from Herculaneum, dated before 79 CE ({% cite 'Scatozza Höricht 1986' %}, p. 37, no. 53, form 14b); Zadar ({% cite 'Ravagnan 1994' %}, p. 192, no. 383); Siphnos, from a grave dated to the first century CE ({% cite 'Mackworth-Young 1949' %}, pp. 82, 85, plate 28,1); and Cyprus ({% cite 'Vessberg 1956' %}, p. 170, fig. 50, no. 37); and at least two more of unrecorded provenance ({% cite 'Hayes 1975' %}, p. 56, no. 131, fig. 3, plate 8; {% cite 'Whitehouse 1997a' %}, p. 76, no. 95).
