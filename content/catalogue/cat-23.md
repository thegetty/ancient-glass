## Condition

Fully preserved. There is some discoloration, and the vessel is almost fully covered with iridescence. There are a few minor abrasions and scratches. A small part of the thread on the rim is missing.

## Description

Translucent dark blue body; opaque yellow decoration. Broad, horizontal rim-disk; cylindrical neck wider toward the body; rudimentary shoulder; cylindrical body wider toward the bottom; flat bottom with curved edges. Two lugs on the upper part of the body placed unevenly at different heights.

On the neck there is a horizontal band, 2.3 cm long and 1.0 cm wide, that covers a tear in the neck of the vessel. A small horizontal hole is visible below the applied band.

An unmarvered yellow thread is wound around the rim. A white thread is spirally wound 21 times around the upper and middle body, and a yellow thread is wound 13 times around the lower part of the body. The threads are dragged 16 times up and down, forming a feather pattern.
