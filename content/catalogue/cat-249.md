## Condition

Intact; surface dulled, covered by iridescence and incrustations; many pinprick bubbles.

## Description

Fire-polished, horizontal rim, pinched to form 13 shallow scallops; a horizontal flange on the underside of the rim, at the transition to the body. The body is cylindrical, gently tapering toward the slightly convex bottom. Tooled, conical base with slanting tooling marks. At the center of the bottom is a solid, circular pontil mark (W. 0.9 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

Vessels of this form have a horizontal rim with fire-polished, scalloped edge; vertical body walls; flat bottom; and low, pushed-in, slightly conical base-ring ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, p. 58, form 42d). The edge of the rim and the transition from the body to the rim are occasionally emphasized by winding a fine thread of strongly-colored glass around them. The form is dated mainly to the fourth century CE. The fact, however, that vessels of the same shape appear in pottery in the fifth and sixth centuries ({% cite 'Hayes 1972' %}, pp. 50–51, 82–83; {% cite 'Robinson 1959' %}, p. 116, no. 349, plate 71), and also in silverware in the sixth century ({% cite 'Boyd 1992' %}, p. 29, S44.1, S44.2), makes it quite likely that glass vessels continued to be produced at least during the fifth century, as is also indicated by glass finds from several western Mediterranean sites ({% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, p. 67, form 18).
