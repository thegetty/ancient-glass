## Condition

Fragment. Heavily weathered and discolored with a milky yellow iridescence.

## Description

Hollow statuette of a human figure, probably male. It was formed of an originally conical hollow mass of glass that was squeezed to assume a lentoid cross section; three constrictions at regular intervals indicate the neck, the waist, and the beginning of the legs. Fine threads are applied on the sides, forming small loops that render the arms and ears of the figure. The lower legs are broken off. Possibly the finial of a vessel.
