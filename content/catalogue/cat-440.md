## Condition

Pastiche of two rim fragments.

## Description

This pastiche consists of the rims of two different flasks, which have been conjoined, creating the form of a miniature stemmed beaker.

The body of the beaker is made from the out-folded rim and wide upper neck, part of the neck of a vessel dated probably in the fourth century from Egypt (e.g., {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, pp. 105–106, form 58 or 59). The funnel-shaped mouth with in-folded, tubular rim of a flask that has been placed upside-down forms the stem and base of the pastiche. It is probably dated in ca. third–fourth century CE (e.g., {% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, p. 146, no. 202). The interior of this part is filled with what appears to be a glass lump, which forms the flat bottom of the body. It has been painted carefully to the exact same tone of green as the glass fragments. The seam between the two fragments is covered with a fine layer of some kind of plaster painted appropriately.
