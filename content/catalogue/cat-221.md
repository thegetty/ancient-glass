## Condition

Mended; some small chips are missing from the body and rim. Iridescence and on small areas a white layer of weathering.

## Description

Fire-polished rim; conical mouth; tall biconical body; pushed-in, conical base; concave bottom. The body is covered with twisted, dip mold–blown ribs. A fine trail wound once on the bottom of the neck delineates the transition to the body.

## Comments and Comparanda

Vessels like this one, which were first blown in a small and shallow mold and then further expanded by free-blowing, that is, dip mold–blown, mainly appear in the fourth and early fifth centuries CE ({% cite 'Stern 2001' %}, pp. 27, 133–134; {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, pp. 18–19). A quite close parallel is in the National Museums of Scotland ({% cite 'Lightfoot 2007' %}, p. 96, no. 224).

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
