## Condition

Intact; partly covered by white crust from weathering. The tip of the lid is missing.

## Description

Horizontal rim with fire-polished lip; cylindrical body with folded, horizontal flange at top and bottom; flat, slightly concave bottom. No pontil mark is visible on the bottom.

Conical, lopsided lid. It is free-blown, like a small vessel with flaring fire-polished rim; wide neck widening toward the bulbous body, which was folded and pressed, forming a wide horizontal, slightly convex band. This band secured the lid on the opening of the vessel. The rim of the lid is tapered, ending in a tubular tip.

## Comments and Comparanda

In Roman times, inkwells, *atramentaria* in Latin ({% cite 'Hilgers 1969' %}, s.v. “atramentarium,” pp. 39, 112), were predominantly made of metal and clay, but in the first century CE they were also rendered in glass. Three forms of glass inkwells have been identified: two with cylindrical body and one with short hemispherical body. Their use becomes evident from the narrow opening with fire-polished edge that is placed at the center of the horizontal upper surface of the vessel, as in the clay and metal inkwells ({% cite 'Fünfschilling 2012' %}, pp. 194–195; {% cite 'Eckardt 2017' %}, pp. 53–107). The more widely distributed shorter and wider cylindrical form was probably produced in the west. The form was supplemented with three loop handles on the upper surface of the vase ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, p. 93, form 77). A slender, handleless cylindrical form is ascribed to eastern Mediterranean workshops ({% cite 'Whitehouse 1997a' %}, p. 199, no. 347, and particularly comments on no. 360; {% cite 'Israeli 2003' %}, p. 121, no. 118) (this vessel, {% cat '2003.240' %}). This form was supplemented with a lid, either biconical or cylindrical. A less widely distributed variant, rendered in clay as well ({% cite 'Broneer 1935' %}, pp. 72–73, fig. 17; {% cite 'Eckardt 2017' %}, pp. 55–57), has a hemispherical body and a seemingly flat or slightly convex upper surface with narrow fire-rounded rim at the center and one handle ({% cat '2003.378' 'cats. 374' %}–{% cat '2003.453' '375' %}). There are parallels from the eastern Mediterranean that date the form to the first–second centuries CE ({% cite 'Lightfoot 2013a' %}, pp. 426–427, figs. 3–4: [http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/249364](http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the–collection–online/search/249364); {% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005' %}, pp. 187, 249, no. 752; {% cite 'Davidson 1952' %}, p. 101, no. 636, fig. 8; {% cite 'Antonaras 2022a' %}, pp. 68–69, no. 443).
