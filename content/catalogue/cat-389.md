## Condition

Pastiche. Repaired break at neck, between the neck and the body. Body has a smaller opening than the neck.

## Description

In-folded, flattened rim; conical neck with a coil wound spirally five times around it; four-sided body, square in cross section; wedge-shaped feet.

Deeply cut decoration. Triangular bevels pointing upward are cut on the corners of the upper body, leaving a prunt below them that delineates a deep horizontal groove that run along the middle of the body. Below the groove on the corners are small semicircular bevels, and at the center of each side, a deep, triangular bevel delineates four pyramidal, wedge-shaped feet.
