## Condition

Fragment, broken all around.

## Description

The fragment was cut into an angular tile, possibly a lozenge, probably in antiquity. The dark olive-green body is decorated with opaque green rods, which appear lengthwise due to the distortion of the matrix when it was formed by slumping.
