## Comments and Comparanda

Bowls featuring a honeycomb pattern on their walls are a relatively widespread form among dip mold–blown vessels, that is, vessels which were first blown in a small and shallow mold and then further expanded by free-blowing. They are found throughout the Roman Empire, and several regions have been proposed to be their production sites, including western parts of the empire, the Black Sea region, Syria, and Egypt ({% cite 'Hayes 1975' %}, p. 147; {% cite 'Barkóczi 1971' %}, p. 83; {% cite 'Dusenbery 1971' %}, p. 16). Usually there is a band of vertical ribs below the rim, and below that is the web of hexagonal cells, which may be distorted due to the production technique. In addition, in some cases the honeycomb pattern is supplemented by concentric circles, applied blobs, or a rosette at the center of the bottom.
