## Description

Fire-polished rim, smooth and vertical; hemispherical body; flat, slightly concave bottom. Body decorated with 21 vertical, slightly oblique ribs, unequal in size. Ribs begin 2.3 cm below the rim and range in size between 2.5 and 4 cm. In the interior, 0.5 cm below the rim, one horizontal groove, 0.2 cm wide.

## Comments and Comparanda

The ribbed bowl is a form known from Hellenistic times (fourth–first centuries BCE) and is one of the most popular glass vessels in the Roman Empire and beyond its frontiers between the first century BCE and the first century CE. It has been quite convincingly proposed that they were made by pressing a mass of hot glass on a former mold placed on a rotating surface, enabling the craftsman to form slightly uneven ribs at relatively equal distances in an easy and swift way, although that often resulted in a mild obliquing of the ribs. The exterior of the rim is flattened or usually ground ({% cite 'Lierke 1993' %}, pp. 218–234; {% cite 'Lierke 2009' %}, pp. 52–55; {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 75–79). On the interior, horizontal grooves are often incised under the rim, at mid-body, and on the bottom.

Ribbed bowls appear in three main shapes: shallow ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 18–19, form 3a), deep ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 19–20, form 3b), and deep with a tall, conical base-ring. In addition, the length of the ribs has been used as a typological criterion, with those bearing short ribs on the middle of their body clustered in another group ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 20–21, form 3c). They were made in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean; in Italy vessels were made of deliberately colored dark blue and purple glass; of naturally colored blue, green, and amber glass; and of mosaic glass; in the eastern Mediterranean mostly naturally colored bluish-green and amber vessels were produced and used ({% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 308–309).
