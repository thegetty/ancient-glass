## Condition

Fully preserved. Some weathering has given the vessel a blue-purple iridescence. There is also some incrustation. The white thread has almost entirely fallen off.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; cylindrical neck; bulbous body constricted above the middle, forming a wide concave band at the largest diameter; flat bottom. No pontil mark visible on the underside. A fine white thread was spirally wound 10 times from the base of the neck to the bottom.
