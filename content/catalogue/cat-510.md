## Condition

Partly preserved.

## Description

Vertical rectangular panel tapering toward the base; uneven, flat back; straight sides, (top and bottom missing). One hole on the preserved upper part. Molded decoration on front: a series of two volutes appear on the preserved fragment; the entire bead quite probably comprised three volutes (a large hole was running horizontally through the volute at the bottom), each with a truncated pyramidal spike projecting out at left; three pairs of wavy lines in relief run vertically down volutes, with probably six finer lines between spikes on left.
