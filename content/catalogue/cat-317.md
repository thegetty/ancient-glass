## Condition

Intact. Large portions of the thread are missing, as indicated only by the cavities where it originally lay. Small areas with iridescent weathering, especially on the rim.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; long cylindrical neck, wider toward the squat, bulbous body, which is standing on a flat, slightly concave bottom. A white thread of glass has been spirally wound 16 times from the center of the bottom to the rim and dragged up five times, forming a pattern of festoons on the upper body and neck area. The fusion of the thread into the body of the vessel was achieved by applying it at an early stage of the blowing and marvering it before the vessel was given its final dimensions.

## Comments and Comparanda

This form of small flask, known also as an unguentarium or balsamarium, is quite common in both the east and the west in the first half of the first century CE. They appear either undecorated or with spirally wound trails, more often marvered flush with the surface.
