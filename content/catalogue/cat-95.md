## Condition

Single body fragment; three sides are straight, probably cut in modern times.

## Description

The fragment gets thinner toward the curved end, where the body of the vessel was starting to rise. It consists of two types of rectangular tesserae: (1) heavily distorted, eight-petaled green rosette outlined in yellow, set in red; (2) eight-petaled blue rosette outlined in white, set in blue. On the back side, heavily distorted, are the same two types of tesserae.

Small fragments of mosaic glass vessels were sold in Rome between 1860 and 1920, where they were found, and most of the now-known examples that eventually ended up in museum collections were acquired there in that period. At the time, art dealers polished them to renew their bright, colorful appearance and often placed them in gold cardboard frames, giving them the appearance of a valuable object, even a jewel or a gem, like {% cat '2003.258.1' 'cats. 87' %}, {% cat '2003.258.5' '109' %}, and {% cat '2003.258.4' '129' %} ({% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 243–244). The fragments in the JPGM collection are quite diverse, representing different classes of mosaics made with round florets and shorter and longer stripes of glass in many colorful combinations. In addition to the vessel fragments, in the collection there are several flat pieces ({% cat '2003.261' 'cats. 453' %}–{% cat '2003.266' '496' %}) that were originally formed as plaques or bands, to be used as decorative features of wall revetments and/or on movable objects such as furniture, caskets, or musical instruments; these have geometric, floral, maritime, and anthropomorphic (including theatrical masks) motifs, on which see comments on {% cat '2003.260' %}.
