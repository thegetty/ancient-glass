## Condition

Fully preserved; small part of the body is missing; surface iridescent.

## Description

In-folded, tubular, flaring rim; cylindrical neck with tooling marks. The body, in the shape of a pine cone, is covered with 10 rows of large hemispherical knobs imitating the scales of a pine cone. Formed in a bipartite mold; vertical seam hardly noticeable among the knobs on the surface.

## Comments and Comparanda

This form of mold-blown flask rendered in the shape of a pine cone with pointed base is quite rare ({% cite 'Stern 1995' %}, pp. 181–182, no. 110). The type appears in two variants: one with broken-off rim, appearing predominantly in southern and western Switzerland and northern Italy; and vessels with folded rim like this vessel, known from Crete ({% cite 'Carington-Smith 1982' %}, p. 280, nos. 63–64) and other private collections ({% cite 'Auth 1976' %}, p. 73, no. 73; {% cite 'La Baume and Salomonson 1976' %}, p. 39, no. 79, plate 9:2).

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
