## Description

In-folded, tubular, flaring rim; tall cylindrical neck, tapering toward the body, constricted at its base; lentoid body; flat, slightly concave bottom; a pair of looped coil handles of greenish-blue glass extend from shoulder to mid-neck. Body covered with 27 mold-blown oblique, S-shaped ribs up to the handle bases. Shoulders are smooth. Tool-mark depressions on both sides of upper part of the body. At the center of the bottom is a solid pontil mark (W. 1.9 × 0.9 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

Double-handled, lentoid flasks with oblique, mold-blown ribbing on the body are known from the Syro-Palestinian region in the fourth–fifth centuries CE ({% cite 'Barag 1970a' %}, vol. 2, plate 37, type IX:8). On most of them the handles are made of a strikingly different glass color ({% cite 'Hayes 1975' %}, p. 106, no. 389; {% cite 'Israeli 2003' %}, p. 269, no. 359; {% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005' %}, p. 396, nos. 1069–1070; {% cite 'Miho Museum 2001' %}, p. 106, no. 156; {% cite 'Antonaras 2012' %}, p. 96, no. 113), although single-colored examples are known as well ({% cite '*3000 Jahre Glaskunst*' %}, p. 88, nos. 317–318; {% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005' %}, p. 397, nos. 1071–1072).
