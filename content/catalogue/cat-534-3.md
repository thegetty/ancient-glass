## Condition

Mended; part missing

## Description

### COLORS OF UPPER AND LOWER PARTS

Blue and at the edge of the hole a fine red coil

### BASE MASS

It can be seen that the face floret reaches the hole. Probably no matrix, just the florets one next to the other; the bands around the hole were added for extra strength and to cover the profile of the mosaic sections.

### FACES: NUMBER AND OUTLINE

Three female faces with necklace and long hair on the nude shoulders. In a green, square outline.

### ADDITIONAL PLAQUES 

Four rows of red lozenges flanked on either side by a white, a yellow, and another white row of lozenges, which are framed by a row of red triangular tesserae pointing toward the interior of the plaque.
