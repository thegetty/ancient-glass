## Condition

Probably pastiche; mended. Iridescence on the exterior and a dark incrustation on the interior. Repaired break at neck. Unclear if the neck and body go together. Neck fragment is probably not from the same vessel. Chemical analyses could not specify this, due to the thick layer of patina on them.

## Description

Flat, ground, vertical rim; conical neck, constricted at its bottom; rounded shoulder; four-sided body, square in cross section; short, wedge-shaped feet.

Deeply cut decoration. Around the bottom of the neck there are semicircular facets. Horizontal groove along the middle of the body; two vertical strokes from there to the shoulder. Two horizontal strokes on the upper end of each corner, leaving a prunt below it and another one further down at mid-body.
