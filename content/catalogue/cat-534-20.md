## Condition

Intact

## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of blue glass. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible. The two bands are applied onto this surface. There is a zone of anthemia: three palmettes with five red leaves set in white and outlined in a fine yellow; three lotus flowers with the yellow central stem capped in red; and two flaring blue petals, standing on two spiraling stems. There are no additional plaques.
