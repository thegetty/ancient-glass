## Condition

Intact; some pitting on the surface. Reddish remains of the core in the interior.

## Description

Broad, flaring rim-disk; cylindrical neck; convex shoulder; top-shaped body; conical base-knob. Two vertical strap handles extend from the shoulder to the middle of the neck.

Opaque white ground; translucent purple decoration. An unmarvered thread is wound around the rim and base. A marvered thread is wound spirally from shoulders to mid-body, at first in two horizontal lines and from the greatest diameter downward dragged up and down, forming a zigzag pattern. Another marvered thread is wound twice below the zigzags.

## Comments and Comparanda

The amphoriskos (small amphora) was one of the ceramic vessel forms that was rendered in glass by the core-forming technique from the sixth century BCE onward, when this technique, known in Mesopotamia and Egypt since the middle of the second millennium BCE, was introduced in the Aegean world. In addition to amphoriskoi, alabastra, aryballoi, and oinochoiskai (juglets) were imitated in core-formed glass. It is believed that they functioned as unguentaria, intended for aromatic and cosmetic substances ({% cite 'Harden 1981' %}; {% cite 'McClellan 1984' %}; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 109–125; {% cite 'Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994' %}, pp. 37–44).

This object belongs to the earliest group of Aegean core-formed vessels, dating from the middle of the sixth century to the end of the fifth century BCE ({% cite 'Harden 1981' %}, pp. 58–99; {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, pp. 110–115), which were made either of blue glass and decorated with white, yellow, and turquoise threads or of milky white glass decorated with purple threads. Vessels of this group have been found in great numbers in Rhodes, Macedonia, the Aegean islands, and Italy. For the classification of this particular amphoriskos, see {% cite 'Grose 1989' %}, class I:A, amphoriskos form I:2; for the class, see p. 143, nos. 94–95; for the form, see p. 145, no. 101.
