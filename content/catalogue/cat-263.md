## Condition

Mended; small part filled. Iridescent weathering on the interior.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; conical body with flat bottom. Standing on an applied, conical base. Two applied coils; pinched to form a continuous frieze of seven ovals around the body. A fine thread is carelessly wound twice, 2 cm below the rim. An annular pontil mark (W. 1.4, Th. 0.4 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

In general this form of beaker probably derives from the beakers with applied decoration and pushed-in base that were in fashion in western Europe from the middle of the first century to the early second century CE ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 47–48, form 33; {% cite 'Berger 1960' %}, p. 47, plate 7; {% cite 'Cool and Price 1995' %}, p. 71; {% cite 'Ravagnan 1994' %}, n. 248, p. 131). True parallels are known from Hungary ({% cite 'Barkóczi 1988' %}, p. 91, no. 128, plate XI, LXXV), dating to the third century CE. Examples with the lower ends of the decoration freely hanging are also known from Cologne ({% cite 'Fremersdorf 1959' %}, pp. 71–72, plates 108, 109; {% cite 'Doppelfeld 1966' %}, pp. 58–59, plate 132), dated to the third–fourth centuries CE. In addition, an unprovenanced parallel in the Corning Museum of Art has been published ({% cite 'Whitehouse 2001a' %}, p. 137, no. 675).
