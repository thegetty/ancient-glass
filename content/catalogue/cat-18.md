Fully preserved; mended and repaired near the bottom. Surface pitted.

## Description

Brownish-purple, now opaque, body; opaque turquoise decoration. Horizontal rim-disk; short, cylindrical neck, tapering toward the body; rudimentary sloping shoulder; cylindrical body, wider toward the shallow, convex bottom. Two opposing ring handles with knobbed tails on the shoulders.

A probably white unmarvered thread, now gray due to weathering, is wound around the rim. One white thread, now mainly appearing turquoise, is spirally wound 21 times around the neck and body, in almost horizontal rows.
