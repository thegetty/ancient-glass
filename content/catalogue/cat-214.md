## Condition

Intact; iridescence and pitting.

## Description

In-folded, flaring rim; concave neck; ovoid body; flat base. Two opposing coil handles are applied on the shoulder, drawn upward, and attached to the upper part of the neck. Handles positioned at 90 degrees from the mold seam. Vessel is shaped like a miniature amphora encased in a wicker basket of horizontal dashes. Two bands with herringbone, the upper facing to the left and the lower facing to the right, divide it into three parts. Flat base bisected by mold seam.

## Comments and Comparanda

The vessel renders the shape of a miniature amphora encased in a wicker basket in a similar fashion to the two examples in the JPGM collection produced by the Workshop of the Floating Handles, {% cat '2003.309' 'cats. 212' %}–{% cat '2003.310' '213' %}. The single published close parallel is held by Wheaton College, in Norton, Massachusetts ({% cite 'Dusenbery 1971' %}, p. 14, no. 11, fig. 8).

## Provenance
