## Description

### COLORS OF UPPER AND LOWER PARTS

Green

### BASE MASS

None. The back side of the mosaic sections is visible. The two bands are applied onto this surface. In the thread hole it can been that there is a multicolored banded mass behind the central band of the florets. Quite probably this is the distorted back side of the mosaic sections. What is visible, though, are alternating fine rows of red and blue. 

### FACES: NUMBER AND OUTLINE

Three Medusa heads. Short, sleek hair all around the face. Set in a fine round white frame, set in a larger, square blue field. 

### ADDITIONAL PLAQUES 

Three square tiles. In each one are set, in translucent dark blue field, two yellow, one green, and one red triangle, all facing toward the center.
