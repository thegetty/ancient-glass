## Condition

Rim and upper neck repaired; weathering mostly along the white cane on the exterior.

## Description

Out-turned and flattened rim; short, cylindrical neck, tapering toward the squat, piriform body; flat bottom. From base to rim, a spiral white trail with at least 14 revolutions from bottom to neck. Seven pinched vertical ribs around the body from bottom to neck.

## Comments and Comparanda

Piriform flasks with spiraling thread around the body and pinched ribs are a well-known form in the first century CE ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, pp. 40, form 26b). It has been proposed that they originate from the eastern Mediterranean and were copied in Italy ({% cite 'De Tommaso 1990' %}, pp. 53–54, type 24). Published examples are from sites like Cologne ({% cite 'Fremersdorf 1961' %}, p. 40, plate 60); Trier ({% cite 'Goethert-Polaschek 1977' %}, form 70c, pp. 114–115, nos. 618–619, plate 1:4d, 8:94d); Aquileia ({% cite 'Mandruzzato and Marcante 2007' %}, p. 77, no. 129, p. 36 color ill.); Marone ({% cite 'Facchini 2007' %}, pp. 69–70, no. 114); Cyzicus ({% cite 'Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005' %}, p. 276, no. 826); Dura-Europos ({% cite 'Clairmont 1963' %}, p. 47, no. 179, plate 23); and museum collections, such as the Yale Art Gallery ({% cite 'Matheson 1980' %}, p. 27, nos. 72–73); Landesmuseum Württemberg, Stuttgart ({% cite 'Stern 2001' %}, p. 63, no. 7).
