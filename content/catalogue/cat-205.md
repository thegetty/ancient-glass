## Condition

Fully preserved; small fill on the rim; some iridescence in the interior.

## Description

Slightly flaring, in-folded, tubular rim; short, cylindrical neck; oval body, resting on a flat base. The seam mark indicates that this piece was blown in a mold of two vertical, hemispherical parts. Along the bottom the straight seam between the two parts of the mold is visible. The entire body is decorated with mold-blown relief designs; namely, 28 elongated tongues cover the upper body, and 29 petals cover the lower body. The central part of the body is covered by a tendril scroll, flanked by a groove with raised ridges above and below. Two vertical, coil handles have been applied to the shoulder and drawn up to the mouth. One handle is dark gray with purple striations, and the second is purple with dark gray striations.

## Comments and Comparanda

There are several published mold-blown flasks decorated with a tendril scroll around the body that is flanked by tongues and petals, decoration that appears in at least three different variants. They have either one or two handles, and it has been suggested ({% cite 'Stern 1995' %}, p. 152) that they represent a miniature version of glass amphorae like the ones signed by the famous glassblower Ennion (see {% cite 'Kunina 1997' %}, p. 273, nos. 109–110; {% cite 'Lightfoot et al. 2014' %}, pp. 74, 127, nos. 3, 35).
