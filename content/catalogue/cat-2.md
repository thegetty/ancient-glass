## Condition

Mended, heavily reconstructed, and filled. Discolored from weathering.

## Description

Short cylindrical neck; ovular body; convex bottom. Two opposing milky yellow vertical loop handles are modern restoration.

An unmarvered turquoise or translucent light blue thread around the rim. The dark-colored body is decorated with splashes of opaque turquoise and yellow glass.

## Comments and Comparanda

No direct parallels are published. The vessel could be a flask ({% cite 'Nolte 1968' %}, form I), although it cannot be excluded that it originally had handles ({% cite 'Nolte 1968' %}, form II). Probably connected to the production of a workshop active after the Amarna period in an unknown place, during the Ramesside period (Nineteenth–Twentieth Dynasties; thirteenth–eleventh centuries BCE), where single-colored vessels were made alongside thread-decorated vases of workgroup 5 ({% cite 'Nolte 1968' %}, pp. 127–129, workshop 6).

## Provenance

By 1974–1988, Erwin Oppenländer, 1901–1988 (Waiblingen, Germany), by inheritance to his son, Gert Oppenländer, 1988; 1988–2003, Gert Oppenländer (Waiblingen, Germany), sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2003
