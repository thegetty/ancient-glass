## Condition

Fully preserved. Mended; missing a fragment from the rim.

## Description

Cut-off rim; conical body with convex walls mildly tapering toward the rim and the flat, slightly concave bottom. A faint, annular pontil scar preserved on the bottom (W. approx. 1 cm). Three bands (W. 0.5 cm) of fine horizontal incisions divide the surface of the vessel into three registers, roughly equal in height.

## Comments and Comparanda

This beaker belongs to a well-known first-century CE form with ground rim and cylindrical, ovoid, and truncated conical body ({% cite 'Isings 1957' %}, p. 44, form 29;  {% cite 'Rütti 1991a' %}, form AR 35; {% cite 'Stern 2001' %}, pp. 46, 77, no. 19; {% cite 'Antonaras 2017' %}, p. 74, form 25). The form appears in the Augustan period (27 BCE–14 CE), but the majority of the extant examples date to the reign of Tiberius or Claudius (14–54 CE), and they continue to be produced into the third quarter of the first century ({% cite 'Cool and Price 1995' %}, pp. 68–69; {% cite 'Stern 2001' %}, pp. 46, 79–80). It seems that this form imitates fine eggshell pottery vessels, produced in Italy and the northwestern provinces as early as the second quarter of the first century BCE ({% cite 'Robinson 1959' %}, pp. 11–13, nos. F18, F19, plate 1, group F).
