## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of red glass. The base mass is red, and the two bands are part of it; onto this was applied the central green band. There are two hairless faces, off-axis, set in green. In one of the sections, hardly noticeable, the green outline is square. The color of this outer layer in the second face section is of the same color as the matrix of the bead. No outline is visible. The additional plaques are two round florets with two green and two red triangles facing toward the center, all of them outlined in yellow. There is a fine trail around them, giving the impression that they were not perfectly flush with the green surface.
