## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of light yellow glass. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible. In the thread hole, the bands appear to have been added onto the central band, which is dark colored. There are four Medusas, in a rectangular white and blue frame set in a larger white lozenge, which is set in a dark blue rectangular field. There are no additional plaques.
