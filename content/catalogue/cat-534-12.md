## Condition

Small area is missing from one end

## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of dark blue glass. Visible on one side, over the blue, is a fine red band, which has deteriorated into green in large areas. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible. In the thread hole, the bands appear to have been added onto the central band, which is dark colored. There are three Medusas in a fine round white and a square red frame. The additional plaques are three squares filled with four triangular elements facing toward the center: two yellow, which face each other, and one red and one green facing each other.
