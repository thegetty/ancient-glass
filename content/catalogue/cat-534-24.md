## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of red glass. The base mass is red, and the two bands are part of it; onto this was applied the central green band. There are two faces set freely in the green background without any outline, both set off-axis. The additional plaques are two disks, each divided into segments of green and red, separated by a thin yellow line.
