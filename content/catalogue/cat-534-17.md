## Description

The upper and lower parts of the bead are made of red glass. The base mass is invisible, possibly red. Both red bands in the interior appear to be applied onto a central band. There are three female busts with long hair and necklaces. There is an opaque red band above and on the sides of the heads. The additional plaque is a vertical banded piece: a central red flanked by yellow bands.
