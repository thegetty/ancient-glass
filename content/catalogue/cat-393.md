## Condition

Exterior partly iridescent; interior covered with incrustation. Consists of two pieces, rim and neck, and body piece. Probably a pastiche. The body is ground and flattened around the neck, probably in modern times, so that it could fit with the neck piece.

## Description

Flaring end, in-folded and flattened, forming a horizontal flange that considerably shrinks the width of the opening; short, cylindrical neck; globular body decorated with 20 deep vertical ribs arranged all around; mildly convex bottom. On the bottom, a scar, probably annular pontil scar (W. approx. 1.3, Th. 0.1 cm). Signs of a diaphragm at the bottom of the neck, which was later ground flat.

## Comments and Comparanda

A very close parallel was in a private collection ({% cite 'Loudmer and Kevorkian 1985' %}, p. 224, no. 546), dated in the seventh–eighth centuries CE. Various forms bearing mold-blown ribbing have been published from Fustat, Egypt, dated in the eighth–ninth centuries CE ({% cite 'Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001' %}, pp. 70–73, form 35a–p). For a jar with finer mold-blown vertical ribbing dated in the eighth–tenth century, in the Israel Museum, see {% cite 'Brosh 2003' %}, p. 353, no. 471.
