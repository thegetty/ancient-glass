## Condition

Small part chipped off

## Description

The upper and lower parts are made of green glass. There is no base mass, and the back side of the mosaic sections is visible. The entire thread hole is covered with a dark, seemingly black color that appears to continue under the light green bands that encircle it. There are three faces outlined in square, white and blue frames. Two faces are consecutively placed and the third is flanked by the checkerboard tiles. The additional plaques are three polychrome mosaic squares made of triangular microtesserae: a central translucent green square surrounded by four red triangular tesserae facing outward and forming thus a lozenge, which is surrounded by a yellow and a dark-colored—probably dark blue—lozenge and white, red, and by white tesserae forming triangles.
