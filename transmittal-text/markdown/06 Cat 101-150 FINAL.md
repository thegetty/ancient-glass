## Description

Flat fragment of what was probably the bottom of a wide bowl or plate. On the back side a curved scar indicates the trail of the base-ring, which was probably a translucent purple rod that was removed when the fragment was repolished, probably in modern times. The vessel was made of florets of two types: (A) a central yellow rod surrounded by six yellow rods set in translucent purple, set in red; (B) a central rod comprising rolled white and transparent yellowish layers surrounded by seven red rods set in translucent purple, outlined by a white layer. The same motif on both sides of the vessel.

The shape of the tesserae, with the dentate band, is not present among the Roman mosaic vessels. For a small piece of glass that was made of tesserae probably identical to those of 76.AF.70.17 and was ground in the shape of a human incisor set in gold frame used as a pendant dated to the tenth century CE see [[Antonaras 2019]], pp. 186–187, no. 246. The mosaic technique was revived for a brief period during the ninth and tenth centuries, creating what was probably a very limited and clearly costly production line whose creations were nevertheless widely distributed from Egypt to Iran ([[Carboni and Whitehouse 2001a]], pp. 147–153; [[Goldstein et al. 2005]], pp. 86–87).

## Condition

Mended. Small cavities at the bottom filled. Neck and part of rim not preserved.

## Description

The body at the top ends at a horizontal, flat edge which is ground on the exterior; everted conical body with straight walls tapering toward the rim; convex pointed bottom. The vessel is made from five parallel lengths of canes set horizontally on the body. The canes are set in the following order: dark blue, white, green, white, and blue.

A fine groove or crack is visible along the seams between the bands. The edge of each band is not perfectly straight, and each one is set at a slightly different angle. Along the white band a vertical crack is visible.

## Comments and Comparanda

This alabastron belongs to a very rare group of vessels with juxtaposed sections of glass of contrasting colors forming simple geometric designs. This technique was used for the production of bowls ([[Oliver 1967]], p. 1, figs. 6–9) as well as alabastra. The size and shape of these banded alabastra are almost identical to the gold-band alabastra of Oliver’s ([[Oliver 1967]], pp. 20–22) group A. For comparanda see from Soli, Cyprus, a vessel with blue, white, and blue bands: [[Myres 1899]], p. 104, no. 2808, illustrated in [[Oliver 1967]], p. 19, fig. 10.

## Description

Bowl with vertical rim and convex, curving body tapering gradually toward the mildly convex bottom. Thick and tall conical applied base-ring made of a length of translucent yellow glass.

The striped mosaic pattern of the vessel is formed from 16 lengths, varying in size, of two types of composite canes laid in parallel rows across the body and extending from the bottom to the rim. The canes are alternately: (1) white flanked by red and purple layers of glass and (2) white flanked by yellow layers. The rim is a twisted cane of a transparent yellowish ground and a fine opaque white thread wound spirally. The base is a translucent yellow cane.

## Comments and Comparanda

Different forms of Hellenistic mosaic bowls are known, and three different kinds of mosaic (network, striped, or ribbon and composite mosaic) were used for their production ([[Weinberg 1965]]; [[Oliver 1968]]; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 189–197; and more recently [[Lightfoot 2019]]). The production center of mosaic and network mosaic vessels remains unknown, although a proposed location is Alexandria, Egypt ([[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2000]], p. 18, 140).

This particular bowl belongs to a group of late Hellenistic glass mosaic vessels, examples of which have been recovered from a shipwreck that sank ca. 80 BCE off the island of Antikythera in the Aegean, carrying a diverse cargo traveling from the eastern Mediterranean to Italy ([[Kaltsas, Vlachogianni, and Bouyia 2012]], with all previous bibliography).

There are at least three direct comparanda of ribbon bowls (with ring-base and upright rim): the first was recovered from the Antikythera shipwreck ([[Weinberg 1965]], pp. 34, 37, no. 7, figs. 15–16; [[Weinberg 1992]], p. 108, no. 69; [[Avronidaki 2012]], p. 140, no. 104), and the other three are unprovenanced (Metropolitan Museum of Art 1929.100.86: [[Oliver 1968]], pp. 55–56, fig. 8; [[Lightfoot 2019]], p. 173, fig. 6; Yale Art Gallery 1955.6.28: [[Matheson 1980]], pp. 12–13, no. 38; [[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 298–299, no. 86). This same bowl shape is also formed with network and millefiori glass ([[Oliver 1968]], pp. 55–56).

## Description

The bowl has a flaring lip, conical, cyma recta body, and flat bottom and stands on a tall, splaying ring-base, formed by a single revolt of an applied coil of glass.

The vessel is made of rectangular mosaic tesserae, monochrome yellow, white, and blue with a thin white layer in the middle. In addition, discoid sections have been used composed of a central white rod set in blue, around which have been spirally wound 1.5 revolts of a translucent yellowish ground with a thin layer of opaque yellow glass on it. The lip of the rim is a twisted cane of transparent glass around which is twisted a very fine white thread.

The coil of the base is ribbon mosaic comprising wavy but parallel layers of blue, white, and yellow glass.

## Comparanda

This bowl belongs to a group of late Hellenistic glass mosaic vessels, examples of which have been recovered from a shipwreck that sank ca. 80 BCE off the island of Antikythera in the Aegean, loaded with diverse cargo traveling from the eastern Mediterranean to Italy ([[Kaltsas, Vlachogianni, and Bouyia 2012]], with all previous bibliography). This particular shape of bowl with flaring rim is among the least represented among the late Hellenistic mosaic vessels ([[Oliver 1968]], pp. 56–57; [[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 300–301, no. 87). It was made with ribbon and mosaic-patterned glass, as was one from Tripoli, Libya Museum ([[Oliver 1968]], pp. 56). A similar striped mosaic example in the British Museum ([[Tatton-Brown and Andrews 1991]], p. 56, color plate 65) is said to be from one of the Greek islands. In addition, there are vessels made with millefiori mosaic (example from Antikythera Group: [[Weinberg 1965]], pp. 35–36, nos. 4, 6, figs. 11, 14; [[Weinberg and McClellan 1992]], p. 108, no. 66; [[Avronidaki 2012]], pp. 143–144, no. 105) and network glass ([[Oliver 1968]], p. 57, fig. 11; [[Lightfoot 2019]], pp. 169–170, fig. 3).

## Condition

A number of repaired breaks visible, and there are some nicks and scratches. Some discoloration and weathering on the exterior surface, in addition to pitting, which has produced the rough appearance of the surface.

## Description

The bowl has a slightly flaring lip, conical, cyma recta body, and flat bottom; stands on a tall, circular ring-base formed by an applied coil of glass.

The vessel is made of discoid mosaic tesserae of a single type, composed of fine white rods surrounded by brownish translucent glass. Some of the tesserae on the exterior have been fused almost vertically, probably as a result of movement during action of the slumping technique, so that the white rods appear elongated, as short, wavy white threads in the dark-colored body of the vessel. In the interior they mostly appear in cross section as white spots.

## Comments and Comparanda

This bowl belongs to the Roman Cast Composite Mosaic Vessels group and in particular to the Non-Carinated Bowls ([[Grose 1989]], pp. 258–261), which are one of the largest groups of mosaic vessels, with deep and shallow bowls being among the most widely appearing forms; others include plates and beakers. For the production technique see [[Dawes 2002]] and comments on [85.AF.85](#cat). Broad, shallow bowls similar in shape are in the collection of the Toledo Museum of Art ([[Grose 1989]], nos. 539–540).

## Description

Vertical, slightly everted, rounded rim; deep body with convex sides tapering toward the flat bottom. A fine incised horizontal groove in the interior right below the rim.

The vessel is made of discoid mosaic tesserae of a single type composed of fine white rods (possibly 11) surrounded by translucent dark blue glass. Most tesserae have been fused almost vertically, probably as a result of the movement during the action of the slumping technique, so that the white rods appear elongated as short, wavy white threads in the dark-colored body of the vessel.

## Description

Deep hemispherical bowl. The body is formed by bent, twisted ribbon canes arranged in pairs of the following two types: (1) reticella of two yellow threads twisted around a colorless ground; (2) twisted cane of a white thread wound around purple ground. The rim is finished with an applied twisted coil of white and blue glass.

## Comments and Comparanda

This bowl belongs to a relatively rare class of mosaic ware found mostly in Italy and neighboring regions. It is known as Network Mosaic, or reticella, and is made exclusively of cut lengths of single-network canes placed and fused next to each other and then sagged over a former mold. It is closely related to the striped mosaic wares with parallel-row pattern and appear in shallow and deep bowls and possibly in pyxides too. This type of reticella derives from a group of Hellenistic glass mosaic vessels where the stripes were spirally arranged, with known examples from the Canosa Group ([[Grose 1989]], pp. 189–191) and the Antikythera Group ([[Weinberg 1965]], pp. 38–39, nos. 10–11, figs. 20–25; [[Weinberg 1992]], pp. 108–110, nos. 71–74; [[Avronidaki 2012]], pp. 143–144, nos. 110–113, wherein all earlier bibliography). Most published Roman examples are made of colorless canes wound spirally with one or two threads, and the rims are formed with an applied twisted cane, usually of an intense color, contrasting with the transparency of the body. The presence of an added twisted thread as a rim links these classes with Hellenistic glass vessels like [2004.23](#num). For general information on the class and parallels, see [[Grose 1989]], pp. 253, 302–303, nos. 400–403, 405. In addition, published parallels are known from sites such as Vindonissa (dated to the Claudian or Neronian period; [[Burger 1960]], pp. 9–13, nos. 4–5, plate 1), Cologne ([[Grose 1989]], p. 196, fig. 111), and Lebanon ([[[Glass from the Ancient World]{.underline} 1957]], pp. 88–89, no. 147 \[not recorded in the checklist of later owners that was published in the [Journal of Glass Studies]{.underline} 3 (1961): 19–153\]), as well as in museum collections, including the Fitzwilliam Museum ([[Fitzwilliam 1978]], p. 28, no. 45); the Museo Nazionale Romano (294080 \[deep\]), the Louvre ([[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2000]], p. 149 and note 23), the Landesmuseum Württemberg ([[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], p. 299), and the Corning Museum of Glass ([[Goldstein 1979]], p. 32 and 193–195, nos. 523–528: <https://www.cmog.org/artwork/lace-mosaic-bowl-0> \[shallow\]; <https://www.cmog.org/artwork/fragment-laced-mosaic-bowl-0>; <https://www.cmog.org/artwork/fragment-laced-mosaic-bowl-7>; <https://www.cmog.org/artwork/fragment-laced-mosaic-bowl-8>).

## Description

Slightly concave body fragment of a mosaic vessel, possibly a bowl. Consists of two kinds of tesserae with ribbed decoration of white, blue, green, and yellow glass: (1) opaque green and yellow bands divided by a thin white layer; (2) a central white band flanked by transparent pinkish, white, and wide dark blue bands. In two cases the way the tessera was fused on the form-mold made the blue band appears to be turquoise.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the production technique see comments on [85.AF.85](#num). On the trade of small fragments of mosaic glass in nineteenth-century Rome and on the different techniques and classes of mosaic glass present in the JPGM collection, see comments on [76.AF.70.21](#num). This bowl belongs to a small class of striped mosaic ware, made of short stripes of composite canes, which are very close in terms of colors and combinations of colors to the parallel-row pattern glass, see [2004.26.9](#num). It has been plausibly proposed by David Grose ([[Grose 1989]], p. 253) that they are made of the leftover clippings of the canes used for the production of the more numerous Parallel-Row class. They are mostly found in Italy and neighboring regions and are made exclusively of cut short lengths of canes placed and fused next to each other and then sagged over a former mold. On the sagging technique see [[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 68–69. Both shallow and deep bowls as well as pyxides were produced with this technique. For general information on the class and parallels see [[Grose 1989]], pp. 252–253, 295–301, nos. 368–389, 393–397.

On the trade of small fragments of mosaic glass in nineteenth-century Rome and on the different techniques and classes of mosaic glass present in the JPGM collection, see comments on [76.AF.70.21](#num). This bowl belongs to Roman cast Composite Mosaic vessels and in particular to the Non-Carinated Bowls group ([[Grose 1989]], pp. 258–261), which are one of the most numerous groups of mosaic vessels, with deep and shallow bowls being among the most widely appearing forms; others are plates and beakers. The checkerboard pattern is quite rare, and the other published examples are broad shallow bowls with single interior grooves and the pattern is created by tesserae in two or three colors ([[Grose 1989]], p. 260, nos. 564–567). There are known carinated mosaic bowls with checkerboard patterns that date this group in the late first century BCE–early first century CE ([[Abdul-Hak 1959]], p. 81, fig. 14; [[Goldstein 1979]], pp. 186–187, no. 497).

Deep hemispherical bowl.

The body is formed by spiraling ribbon canes with bands in the following order: white, blue red, yellow, green, and white. The rim is finished with an applied twisted coil of colorless and yellow glass.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the production technique see comments on [85.AF.85](#num). For comments about the various types of mosaic vessels present in the JPGM collection see [76.AF.70.21](#num).

This bowl belongs to a group of early Roman glass vessels, almost exclusively bowls, deeper or shallow, and occasionally pyxides, distinguished by the applied, twisted coil that formed their rim, and the body almost always made of lengths of composite canes. It can be ascribed to a very small group known with the illustrative name Meandering-Strip Mosaic Vessels that stand outside of the usual for the striped vessels in the Romano-Italian tradition, their body been made of very large cane sections formed of several colored strips that were coiled, forming curvilinear, meandering, or sinuous motifs, and they are dated to the Augustan or Julio-Claudian period ([[Grose 1989]], family II: pp. 252–253, nos. 390–397).

modeling_technique_and_decoration: Made from a polychrome disc-shaped blank assembled from fused together lengths and sections of round mosaic canes; slumped, rotary-polished

inscription: No

shape: Bowl

technique: Slumped

## Condition

Single fragment, broken all around. The exterior is polished, probably in modern times. The interior is slightly dull.

## Description

The fragment is mildly convex and belongs to the bottom of a vessel, probably a bowl. It is composed of banded mosaic sections placed sparsely in an amber-colored matrix. The banded sections comprise five white and dark blue layers of glass interchangeably arranged. In the interior a reverse formation appears as if there are two layers of decoration, one on each surface over an amber-colored matrix. It is more probable that this is the result of the difference in temperature between the exterior and the interior of the glass during the slumping on the form-mold.

The polished exterior retains parts of a circular groove 3.7 cm wide, and a mishap is also visible at one point on the circumference. The cutter placed the wheel on the exact position to form a perfect circle, but something prevented him from finishing the cut at this point and he continued 3 mm farther, giving to the object a slightly off-center, oval shape. After the breakage of the original vessel, it appears that its pieces were retrieved and repurposed as valuable decorative elements and this particular fragment was used as a gem or inlay. In the notch around it is visible a thick layer of weathering probably indicative of some kind of metal setting covering that area for an extended period of time.

## Condition

Mended and filled in some areas of the rim. There are two perforations (Diam. 0.2 cm) at 0.4 cm below the rim, placed across from each other. In the perforations, layers of white weathering are visible.

## Description

Ground vertical rim; hemispherical bowl; flat bottom. The bowl is made of a disk formed from a single composite cane of glass which consists in turn of three wide layers, one a translucent amber-color, and two purple, each flanked by a thin layer of opaque white glass. The cane was bent at least 12 times, creating the illusion of veins in agate.

## Comments and Comparanda

Agate was one of the favorite stones of the Romans, and its rich colors and intricate veins of different colors were rendered in glass in Hellenistic and Roman times ([[Grose 1989]], pp. 192–193, 247–249; [[Weinberg and McClellan 1992]], pp. 56–58, 97–98). Agate glass vessels are known in several shapes, shallow bowls like 2003.253 ([[Platz-Horster 1992]], p. 303, no. 166), deeper bowl ([[Azuma 2001]], no. 127), bottles ([[Fossing 1940]], p. 114, fig. 860), and spindle-shaped alabastra ([[Auth 1976]], p. 53, no. 43; [[Grose 1989]], p. 369, no. 668; [[Schlick-Nolte 2002]], pp. 88–90, V-47). They are ascribed to Italian workshops, especially to Rome. For a gold-band plate see [[Alekseeva and Sorokina 2007]], pp. 54–57, figs. 7–8, plate 37:1–2.

In addition many ribbed bowls were formed with marbled mosaic glass that was a rendition of agate with opaque white wavy veins in a dark-colored translucent matrix, often dark blue or purple, for example, [72.AF.37](#num) ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 19–20, form 3b; [[Antonaras 2017]], pp. 54–56, form 6b).

## Description

Vertical, smooth, fire-rounded rim. Deep convex body decorated with 21 vertical ribs, slightly slanting to the left and relatively evenly spaced. Ribs begin 1.5 cm below the rim and they are visible to the center of the bottom. In the interior, one groove on the lip and two more 1.5 cm from the bottom.

Composite mosaic pattern formed from polygonal sections of a composite cane of amber-colored glass in which a fine, opaque white thread was spiraled two times. The sections were fused together into a single mass, which was slumped over a form-mold, and the ribs were formed by tooling while the form was on a rotating base, probably a potter’s wheel.

## Comments and Comparanda

For agate and marbled vessels see comments on [2003.253](#num). Mosaic glass ribbed bowls are mostly found in the western Roman provinces, and it is assumed that they were probably made in Italy ([[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 73–74, 320), while monochrome ribbed bowls were made and predominantly used in the eastern Mediterranean. Preserved mosaic ribbed bowls imitate usually onyx, using either elongated, ribbon patterns, or large spirals like both examples from JPGM collection ([72.AF.37](#num) and [2004.25](#num)). Both patterns were probably preferred because the distortion created by the ribs enhanced the imitation of veining typical for agate.

This fragment belongs to a class of vessels ascribed to late first-century BCE Egypt, known as Egyptian Cast and Inlaid Bowls ([[Grose 1989]], p. 197). The vessel was formed by slumping a single-colored matrix of glass, on whose surface inlay elements were added, forming a decorative pattern on the surface of the vessel. A fragment of a very similar vessel from Karanis, Egypt, is in the Kelsey Museum in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It is a broad shallow bowl with flowers and wading birds ([[Cool Root 1982]], p. 17, plate 18e). Further parallels from Fayum, Egypt, preserving parts of the depictions of birds, garlands, and loosely arranged stars and rosettes, are published as well ([[3000 Jahre Glaskunst]], p. 41, no. 36, color table F 4= [[Christie’s 1985]], pp. 116–117, no. 225). Another example, a shallow bowl of almost-opaque medium blue glass with floral decoration, is kept in the Toledo Museum of Art ([[Grose 1989]], p. 208, no. 227), and few more are now in the Corning Museum of Glass ([[Whitehouse 2003]], pp. 128–130, nos. 1099–1103).

date: Late first century BCE–early first century CE

start_date: -33

attribution: Production area: Eastern Mediterranean, probably Italy

culture: Roman

material: Translucent blue, purple, and amber-colored; transparent greenish; and opaque white glass; gold

modeling_technique_and_decoration: Fusion and rod-forming. Assembled from prefabricated, composite mosaic canes and sandwich gold-glass strips which were applied lengthwise to a dark blue layer/matrix of glass, around a rod, slumped, and dragged sidewise seven times to create a wavy pattern. The inner lining of glass is slightly visible in the break near the bottom of the vessel

inscription: No

shape: Alabastra

technique: Slumped

## Condition

Mended. Small part of the upper edge of the body is missing and was replaced with some fill. The original neck and rim are also missing and were replaced with that of a ribbon flask.

## Description

Alabastron with removable neck and rim piece. The rim is flaring, almost horizontal, with ground tip, and the neck is cylindrical, covered in the interior with a whitish incrustation. It is made of stripes of white, greenish, purple, light blue, and greenish with gold flakes glass. Originally from a free-blown gold-band flask (cf. [2003.230](#num)). The original necks of the alabastra are very thin, with broad horizontal rim and are usually monochrome.

At the top the body ends in a horizontal, flat edge; everted conical body with straight walls tapering toward the rim; convex pointed bottom. The vessel is made from five parallel wavy lengths of canes set vertically on the body. The canes (0.1 cm thick) are set on a dark blue layer (0.5 cm thick) in the following order: turquoise (actually an opaque white layer under a translucent greenish that appears turquoise by transmitting the color of the underling dark blue layer of the body); amber-color (appearing black) encasing a thin white trail; blue encasing a thin white trail; purple encasing a thin white trail; and a gold-glass band comprising greenish glass with gold flakes in it. This pattern is repeated three times. The interior of the body is smooth and the colors are clearly visible.

## Comments and Comparanda

The gold-band technique involves the use of bands, with a gold foil encased in transparent glass, next to other, colorful bands for the formation of vessels, through rod-forming, core-forming, slumping, and blowing ([[Cesarin 2019]], pp. 45–58).

The use of colorless glass to cover gold foils first appeared in early fourth-century BCE Macedonia and Thessaly for the decoration of shallow, lidded bowls, and finger rings. ([[Ignatiadou 2003]], pp. 4–7; [[Ignatiadou 2017]], pp. 61–67). This technique reappeared in the late third–second century BCE with sandwich gold-glass vessels attributed to Alexandria ([[Harden 1968]], pp. 21–47).

Proper gold-band glass objects comprise one of the rarest groups of Hellenistic and Roman glass objects. Hellenistic gold-band objects include mainly alabastra, some bowls, one skyphos, and a few beads, gems, and inlays. They were produced in the eastern Mediterranean, possibly in or around Alexandria, between the second and the mid-first century BCE. Roman gold-band glass products, datable between the last quarter of the first century BCE and the beginning of the first century CE, are mainly containers for cosmetics and ointments, pyxides, and flasks, and a smaller group consists of sumptuous tableware items, bowls, and one patera ([[Cesarin 2019]]). The largest number is found in Italy, where they were most probably produced, probably in Aquileia and possibly elsewhere in Italy too.

From the third century CE and mainly during the fourth century, gold-glass reappears in various groups of vessels, the most numerous one known as “fonti d’oro.” They are characterized by the use of gold or gilded threads and the protection of the gold leaf with glass roundels and later with an entire layer of glass. It has been proposed that they were produced in Italy, Rhineland, and the eastern Mediterranean ([[von Saldern 2004]], pp. 352–361; [[Whitehouse 1996]], p. 10; [[Howells 2015]]).

The gold-band alabastra were introduced in the first century BCE, and if they were actually used, they were most probably used for holding scented oils and perfumes. This particular example belongs to a more numerous subgroup of these rare alabastra, which are smaller, with wider body and more numerous and narrower colored bands that occasionally overlap ([[Grose 1989]], p. 196; [[Cesarin 2019]], pp. 32–35). On the gold-band glass technique see [[Cesarin 2019]], and especially on Roman gold-band glass techniques pp. 45–70. For direct comparanda see [[Oliver 1967]], pp. 20–23, group B; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 196–197, 208, nos. 225–226; [[Dusenbery 1967]], p. 38, no. 8, fig. 9; [[Filarska 1952]], p. 73, plate 6.5, no. 31; [[Tatton-Brown and Andrews 1991]], p. 57, fig. 66 center; For an overview of all published examples see [[Cesarin 2019]], pp. 133–147, nos.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; wide, short neck; pear-shaped body; slightly concave bottom. Free-blown ribbon jar of eight alternating vertical lengths of two composite canes: four are dark blue and four turquoise (appearing purplish in transmitted light), each one of them flanked by translucent white glass. All three canes begin on one side of the rim and continue down and around to terminate at the same point on the other side of the rim. The canes were assembled and thereafter free-blown to achieve the shape.

## Comments and Comparanda

Slumped and blown color-band vessels represent a separate family of mosaic glass. These vessels are small- or medium-sized flasks or unguentaria. They are made of bands or sections of mosaic canes that were fused to a mass, which was gathered toward the end of the production on the blowpipe, and it was formed using free-blowing. This development is very important for the history of glassworking, because it illustrates the transition from the earlier, Hellenistic and Roman technique of forming glass vessels by slumping a mass of glass over or into a mold to the free-blowing that revolutionized the entire glass industry and dates to the Augustan to Julio-Claudian period. The distribution pattern of provenanced finds indicates that the production center was probably in the western Mediterranean, possibly in Italy ([[Grose 1989]], pp. 261–262).

Small globular and pear-shaped glass jars were popular in the first century CE, mostly made with the free-blowing technique ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 88–89, variants of forms 68; [[Fünfschilling 2015]], p. 391, forms AR 114, AR 115; [[Antonaras 2017]], p. 131–132, forms 98, 99). Jar 2003.277 has the same shape as the aforementioned monochrome vessels, but it is rendered in a different technique that led to the striking, polychrome creation.

## Condition

Mended. Exterior covered with whitish iridescent weathering; interior covered with weathering and soil crust.

## Description

Flaring, flattened rim; cylindrical neck, tapering toward the bulbous body; flat bottom. The vessel consists of ca. 18 amber-color and white rods which were fused together, slumped, and blown to form the closed shape of the vessel and then “combed” 11 times, forming a distinct zigzag pattern. Rotary marks are visible in the interior of the neck.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the production technique see comments on [2003.277](#num).

This type of squat flask is well-known and has been unearthed in different parts of the Roman Empire, mainly in the western areas and Italy, which is considered to be their production site ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 22–23, form 6; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 261–262, 339–340, no. 609). The decoration of these glass vessels was imitating vessels carved from semiprecious stone, especially sardonyx. Published examples include finds from Aquileia ([[Calvi 1968]], plate 5, no.1, 2, 3), Athens ([[Alexandri 1972]], pp. 115–118, plate 76), Zadar ([[Ravagnan 1994]], p. 67, no. 105); Bahrain ([[Nenna 1999b]], p. 188, no. 280). In addition, several examples are in museum collections: the Louvre ([[Arveilleur-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], pp. 74–75, nos. 91, 94–95, 97, probably from Italy); National Museum of Scotland ([[Lightfoot 2007]], p. 48, nos. 46–47); Fitzwilliam Museum ([[Fitzwilliam 1978]], p. 25, no. 38); Miho Museum ([[Miho Museum 2001]], pp. 95, 203, no. 127); previously in the Winfield Smith Collection ([[[Glass from the Ancient World]{.underline} 1957]], p. 89, no. 149). The same shape has been rendered in gold-band mosaic glass as well (see [[Oliver 1967]], p. 23, no. 3, fig. 17; [[Kunina 1997]], p. 268, no. 95), and in a mosaic pattern that may be an example of blown mosaic vessels ([[[Glass from the Ancient World]{.underline} 1957]], p. 85, no. 141).

## Condition

Mended. The surface of the glass is iridescent and pitted, and shows signs of flaking.

## Description

Rim mildly flaring; pinched and flattened cylindrical neck with a constriction at its base, squat, bulbous body with a flattened bottom.

The vessel appears to consist of ca. 20 rods fused together, which repeat the following pattern at least seven times: a wide blue rod is flanked by fine white rods. The rods were slumped to form the closed shape of the vessel and tooled at least four times on each side, forming a distinct zigzag pattern on both sides of it.
