Figure 1. Schematic showing the typology, chronology, and color distribution of the vessels investigated.

Figure 2. Chart listing the chemicals detected in colored glass, with their most common sources.

Figure 3. Three-dimensional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) plot reporting data for the most abundant colors: blue, white, turquoise, and yellow. Each circle represents a data point for each color of glass found on an individual vessel; the data point color corresponds to the vessel’s color. Individual points corresponding to the blue, white, and turquoise analyzed in vessel [2003.203](#num) are highlighted with a red outline. Circled data points correspond to the identified groups White 1 (W1 – purple), and White 2 (W2a, W2b, W2c in incrementally darker shades of green respectively).

Representative vessels for each group discussed in the text: White 1 (W1), White 2 (including W2a, W2b, W2c), Turquoise 1 (T1), Turquoise 2 (T2), and yellow, are shown: a. [2003.180](#num) (W1), b. [2003.203](#num) (W2a), c. [2003.198](#num) (W2b), d. [2003.199](#num) (W3c), e. [2003.197](#num) (T1), f. [2003.196](#num) (T2), g. [2003.172](#num) (Y).
