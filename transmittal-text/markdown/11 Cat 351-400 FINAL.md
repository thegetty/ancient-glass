## Comments and Comparanda

Small lentoid vessels, apparently to contain holy or medicinal liquids, or even perfumes, for personal use, are known from several eastern Mediterranean sites, both cemeteries and habitation areas, dated from Roman to Byzantine and Islamic contexts. Late Roman parallels include: [[Vessberg 1952]], p. 135, plate 7.46, 7.47; [[Abdul-Hak 1965]], p. 28, fig. 5; [[Barag 1970a]], vol. 2, plate 37, type IX:6; [[Fortuna-Canivet 1970]], p. 65, no. 7, fig. 6; [[Auth 1976]], pp. 135, 220, nos. 170, 455; [[Israeli 2003]], p. 268, no. 356; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 258, no. 422; [[Slane 2017]], pp. 67 and 204, plate 53; [[Lightfoot 2017]], p. 290, nos. 439–440; [[Antonaras 2019]], pp. 166–167, nos. 209–210.

material: Translucent purple and greenish; opaque white, yellow, light blue, turquoise, and dark blue glass

modeling_technique_and_decoration: Free-blown

inscription: No

shape: Aryballoi

technique: Free-blown

## Condition

Intact. Some iridescence on the interior; few pinprick bubbles.

## Description

Horizontal rim, folded out, down, and up, with an overhanging flange; short, cylindrical neck; thick-walled, spherical body; flat, slightly concave bottom. Pair of flat strap handles extend from shoulder to halfway up neck. The body is made of translucent purple glass, and the handles of transparent greenish glass.

The entire body is covered with picked-up color chips, that is, the splashware technique. The translucent purple glass \[\[paraison\]\] was marvered to incorporate flakes of various colored glass chips (opaque white, yellow, light blue, turquoise, and dark blue). Subsequently inflated, whereby the chips were distorted in the areas of greatest expansion.

## Comparanda

The form is known in core-formed glass vessels from the sixth century BCE ([2003.174](#num)–[2003.176](#num)). Free-blown glass aryballoi are a well-represented form of globular flasks used to store and transport cosmetic oils in the first and second centuries CE. There are few variants, identifiable in the shape of the rim. On the form see [[Isings 1957]], pp. 78–81, form 61; [[Sorokina 1987]], pp. 40–46 (especially 42), fig. 2:7–8; [[Israeli 2003]], pp. 42, 216; [[Antonaras 2009]], pp. 271–272, form 111 = [[Antonaras 2017]], p. 137; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 264, no. 410; [[Antonaras 2022]], p. 65, nos. 376–378.

technique: Free-blown

## Condition

Intact, with some weathering, more on the interior; some pitting and scratches. Several large, elongated bubbles on the surface.

## Description

In-folded, flaring rim; cylindrical neck, constricted at its bottom, forming a mild diaphragm; globular body; flat bottom. Two opposing red handles applied on the shoulder, drawn upward, and attached to the rim. Black striations along the red ground of the handles. Faint yellow spiraling in the green ground of the vessel.

## Comments and Comparanda

Made with florets—segments of mosaic canes— fused together and then free-blown. Each floret is made of green and yellow glass, probably a green matrix with a central yellow layer. The technique was used mainly for small vessels such as jars, cylindrical cups, jugs, and handled cups. The distribution of findspots indicates that they were circulating from Britain through northwestern Europe to the northern coast of the Black Sea. Quite probably they were produced from the late first century until the second half of the second century CE and occasionally they appear in third-century contexts. The pattern, even when appearing as curved lines, was probably made of florets with circles around a central dot. (On the technique see [[Stern 2017]], pp. 132–139; [[Stern and Fünfschilling 2020]], pp. 41–68. The same technique made the handled cup [2003.287](#num).)

Sprinklers, or dropper flasks, appear in archaeological contexts from the mid-third century onward in the Levantine region and are widespread during the fourth century CE. On sprinklers see comments on [2003.409](#num). There are some indications that sprinklers were produced earlier, at least from the late second century, on the basis of the “snake-thread” decoration they bore ([[Stern 2001]], p. 166, no. 62). For an opaque yellow, pear-shaped dropper flask dated to the third century see [[Whitehouse 1997a]], p. 200, no. 350. For an opaque yellow jar with two handles dated to the first century CE see [[Whitehouse 1997a]], p. 167, no. 292.

In conclusion, given that as far as we currently know the technique of free-blowing with mosaic florets ceases to be used in the second half of the second century CE, but sprinklers appear at before the middle of the third century CE, probably even at the end of the second century CE, this vessel may be dated around the end of the second century CE.

Vertical rim, folded out, down, and up, with an overhanging flange; short, splaying neck merging with the oval body, which is standing on a folded ring-base and a concave bottom. Two opposing strap handles with two ridges attached on the shoulder, pulled up and in, under the rim. The body and the handles are made of translucent purple glass, and are covered with opaque white, yellow, light blue, turquoise, and dark blue chips marvered to be incorporated in the body. The lower part of the handles is stretched downward on the body and pinched seven times.

## Comments and Comparanda

This form is a small-size tableware glass vessel that originated in the Tiberian-Claudian period and remained in use until the end of the first century CE ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 32–34, form 15; [[Biaggio-Simona 1991]], vol. 1, pp. 209–213). Published parallels connect this form to northern Italy and the Ticino region in Switzerland. For amphoriskoi with splashware see [[Berger 1960]], pp. 34–37, plate 4; [[La Baume and Salomonson 1976]], p. 26, no. 17; [[Auth 1981]], p. 60, no. 55; [[von Saldern et al. 1987]], p. 112, no. 45 = [[Whitehouse 1997a]], pp. 209–10, no. 361, acquired in Lebanon; [[Kunina 1997]], pp. 151–152, 293, nos. 187–191 from Pantikapaion near the Black Sea, in particular no. 188. In general on this decorative technique see [[Fremersdorf 1938]], pp. 116–121, summarized in English in [[Harden et al. 1987]], pp. 101–103, and comments on [2003.293](#num). They are divided in three groups on the basis of the size of the speckles and on whether they were marvered into the vessel’s body or if they were left in relief. The amphoriskos 2003.291 belongs to the third group of vessels, where the speckles of colored glass have been applied, heated in situ, and marvered flush and then the vessel was expanded to its final dimensions, greatly distorting the speckles on the areas that expanded the most, in this case on the upper part of the body and the neck.

## Condition

Some weathering around the rim, neck, and handles, giving the vessel a chalky white coat.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; cylindrical neck; ovular body, standing on a pushed-in tubular ring-base; flat bottom. Two opaque white coil handles, with translucent greenish striations, start on the upper body curve and end at mid-height on the neck. The remaining section of the glass thread was bent over the handle, forming a fine ridge along the central part of the coil. The handles are unevenly applied, one starting slightly lower. The body is slightly lopsided and an indentation is visible under the handle, which starts higher, probably induced when the blob of glass which formed the handle was pressed on this area.

## Comments and Comparanda

This form is a miniature variant of a contemporary glass tableware vessel ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 32–34, form 15). Dated parallels, ranging from the early decades of the first century to the very end of the same century, have been published from several sites, including Heddernheim ([[Welker 1974]], pp. 63–65, form 12); Locarno-Muralto ([[Carazzetti and Biaggio-Simona 1988]], p. 45, no. 19, plate ΙΙ); Albenga ([[Massabò 2001]], p. 108–109, 168–169, nos. 58–59, 125); Aquileia ([[Calvi 1968]], p. 24, plates 1.2–1.4); Zadar, Nona, or Benkovac ([[Ravagnan 1994]], pp. 36–37, nos. 29, 31, 33; [[Alfano 1997]], no. 77); Starigrad ([[Fadić 1989]], p. 39, no. 136, plate Χ.2); Kerch ([[Kunina 1997]], p. 321, no. 339); Dura-Europos ([[Clairmont 1963]], p. 30, no. 123, plate 20); Thessaloniki ([[Antonaras 2009]], p. 274–275, nos. 461–462 = [[Antonaras 2017]], p. 138); and Athens ([[Alexandri 1972]], pp. 115–118, plate 76δ). From the distribution pattern of the finds it is assumed that they were produced in northern Italy or Ticino ([[Ravagnan 1994]], pp. 36–37; [[Antonaras 2009]], pp. 274–275, form 113 = [[Antonaras 2017]], p. 138).

## Description

Flaring, in-folded, and flattened rim; cylindrical neck; ovular body, standing on a flat, slightly concave bottom. At the center of the bottom a circular pontil mark (W. 0.9 cm) is visible. Two handles were applied on the neck and drawn down to the shoulder. The remainder of the coils was stretched on the body of the vessel and pressed at four regular intervals, forming an undulating ribbon that ends at mid-height body.

## Comments and Comparanda

This form is a miniature variant of a contemporary glass tableware vessel ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 32–34, form 15; [[Goethert-Polaschek 1977]], pp. 225–227, form 133). Published parallels connect this form to eastern Mediterranean, and more specifically the island of Cyprus ([[Vessberg 1952]], pp. 142–143, 163, amphorisk B1, plate VI:25–26; [[Lightfoot 2007]], p. 115, no. 270). Overall, apart from the crimped endings of the handles, it is very similar to a well-known form of amphoriskos produced in Italy, also dated to the first century ([[Antonaras 2009]], pp. 274–275, form 113 = [[Antonaras 2017]], p. 138).

A fine thread is wound spirally thirteen times around the body and stops at the transition to the base. Two coil handles are placed on the shoulders, over the white thread, bend, forming an open ring, and end on lower neck.

## Comments and Comparanda

Free-blown, small globular and bulbous flasks for oils, occasionally supplemented with small handles ([[Calvi 1969]], plate 1:4; [[Mandruzzato and Marcante 2007]], p. 76, no. 122), appeared in the early first century CE and soon become one of the most widespread forms of flask throughout the Roman Empire ([[Stern 1977]], p. 35; [[De Tommaso 1990]], pp. 39–40, type 5). They were often decorated with spirally wound threads, usually left unmarvered ([[Antonaras 2017]], p. 146, form 122a, wherein several parallels are cited). For additional parallels see comments on [2003.420](#num).

## Condition

Almost fully preserved; part of the rim is replaced. Milky white cloudy weathering on large areas of the interior.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; short neck; biconical, pointed body, which is tooled to form a thick, discoid base stand. Two trails of glass are attached under the rim, are looped six times against the body, and end on the upper body area.

## Comments and Comparanda

The base is flat on the lower side and convex on the upper, indicating that it was probably made by pressing the entire vessel on a flat surface/marver while the blowpipe was still attached to the rim, an assumption corroborated by the fact that on the bottom there is no pontil mark visible. The vessel is made of decolorized glass, which was much more valuable and expensive than ordinary greenish glass. In Roman times glass decolorized with manganese or antimony appears from the last third of the first century CE until the beginning of the fourth century CE, with the greatest distribution from the second quarter of the second to the mid-third century. It was used mainly in western Europe and mostly for tableware, although bottles and unguentaria appear among them as well. ([[Foy et al. 2018]], vol. 1, pp. xiii–xvii; [[Stern 2020]], pp. 769–774). This particular flask form appears in the western provinces ([[Foy et al. 2018]], vol. 2. p. 188, form IN 185; [[Foy and Nenna 2001]], p. 155, no. 201; [[Beretta and Di Pasquale 2004]], p. 205, no. 1.16); plain examples without handles appear also in the first century CE ([[Scatozza Höricht 2012]], p. 140, no. 11294A, plate XXVIII; [[Larese 2004]], no. 393, plate XI; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 214, nos. 323–324).

## Condition

## Description

Fire-polished rim; conical mouth; cylindrical neck; cylindrical body mildly tapering toward the flat, concave bottom. An annular pontil mark (W. 1.3, Th. 0.2 cm) is visible on the bottom. A fine thread is wound under the rim. Two opposing, smooth strap handles start on the tip of the shoulder stretch, vertically, and bend to the very top of the neck. The body of the second handle is not preserved.

The entire body is decorated with applied, curving, smooth threads of various thicknesses which form a snake-thread pattern. Two long-necked and long-legged birds, probably aquatic, in profile turning to the right. In front of each bird is a fine thread that forms numerous loops stretching from shoulder to bottom, bends under it, and returns, ending on the shoulder.

## Comments and Comparanda

Snake-thread vessels were first produced in late second century CE in the eastern Mediterranean, and the technique was transported soon after to the western provinces, where at least two workshops were active, one in Rhineland and the other in Pannonia ([[Harden et al. 1987]], pp. 105–108; [[Stern 2001]], p. 138; [[Dévai 2019]], pp. 325–329). The vessels are grouped stylistically, those with freely applied trails, and the “flower and bird” variety, named after its representations. Eastern examples are made of and mostly decorated with colorless glass; the trails often bear crosshatched lines, and the “flower and bird” pattern is found only among them ([[Barag 1969]]). Colored trails appear in the decoration of western products much more often, and the trails sometimes are not smooth when they bear single lines and not crosshatched ones. An almost identical vessel is in the Corning Museum of Glass (64.1.17: [[Whitehouse 2001a]], p. 223, no. 796)

As to the shape of the vessel, this form of small, undecorated amphoriskos ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 157–158, form 127 miniature version) is known from sites in both eastern and western Roman provinces, and is dated from the third and fourth centuries ([[Antonaras 2017]], p. 157, form 138, wherein further finds, mostly from the Balkans, are cited; also see [[Whitehouse 2001a]], p. 184, no. 729).

## Condition

Mended and covered by beige weathering and iridescence.

## Description

In-folded tubular rim; flaring mouth; short, wide neck; squat, globular body resting on a flat bottom. Two coil handles applied on the shoulders and ending on the rim, forming a small protruding tab. The remaining end of the coil was stretched, bent, and attached along the handle.

The vessel is decorated with a hatched and flattened thread of glass applied in a zigzag pattern, bending 15 times all around the body, from the height of the handles to the bottom. The relief rendering of the surface of the decorative thread ascribes the vessel to the group of the vessels with snake-thread decoration.

## Comments and Comparanda

Free-blown, glass amphoriskoi with wide neck and mouth and taller, ovular body appear in the middle of the first century CE, and they continue to circulate until the early second century ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 32–34, form 15; [[Fünfschilling 2015]], p. 436, form AR 165). This squatter version should be dated, on the basis of the snake-thread decoration, to the third or even fourth century CE. For the distribution and the date of snake-thread decoration see comments on [2003.425](#num).

## Condition

The rim and the handles seem to be modern additions. There are some fills on the body and the upper neck and rim area.

## Description

Cylindrical neck with a constriction at the transition to the spherical body, which stands on a flat bottom. Two white coil handles start at current mid-height of neck, bend, and end at the base of the neck. The body is covered by six partly overlapping, wheel-cut, circular medallions alternately formed by double and triple concentric circles. Along the middle of the body run two horizontal incisions. At mid-height of neck is a horizontal incision.

## Comments and Comparanda

The original rim of the vessel would have been vertical and cut-off, and thus the vessel belongs to a well-known form characterized by the globular body, the constriction at the base of the neck, and the unworked, cut-off rim, which was widely distributed during the third and fourth centuries CE all over the Roman Empire ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 122–123, form 103; [[Antonaras 2017]], pp. 162–163, form 145, wherein further bibliography).

The examples from this group often bear incised decorations, usually simple, consisting of parallel shallow grooves or bands of incisions. Less often, more complex geometrical motifs appear, such as concentric or intersecting circles and bands like on 2003.350; quite rarely there are examples decorated with incised figural motifs ([[Painter 1975]], pp. 54–67; [[Whitehouse 2001a]], pp. 271–272, no. 865) or with painted themes ([[Doppelfeld 1966]], p. 68, plate 165).

Finds with the intersecting circles and bands have appeared at both western and eastern sites, including Cologne ([[Fremersdorf 1967]], pp. 109–111, plate 110, 112; [[La Baume and Salomonson 1976]], p. 70, no. 250, plate 36:3), Bonn ([[Follmann-Schulz 1988]], p. 38, plate 7:88), Ljubljana ([[Petru 1972]], p. 62, no. 6, p. 127, n. 17), Susa in Turin and Castenaso in Bologna ([[Paolucci 1997]], pp. 114–116, where a detailed bibliography of this decoration is compiled), Cherson ([[Kunina 1997]], pp. 167, 299, no. 226), Duklja in Montenegro ([[Cermanović et al. 1975]], pp. 154–155, figs. 12–13), Dura-Europos ([[Clairmont 1963]], pp. 111–112, nos. 540–541, plate XII, XXXIV), Tel el-Hosn, Syria, now in the Yale University Art Gallery ([[Matheson 1980]], pp. 77–78, no. 203). Also, another example of unknown provenance is in the Los Angeles County Museum of Art ([[von Saldern 1980]], pp. 80–81, no. 76).

## Condition

Heavily weathered, iridescent, and pitted areas on most of it.

## Description

Fire-polished rim, in-folded in a small area; wide, conical mouth; almost horizontal shoulder; pear-shaped body, standing on a concave bottom. The entire vessel is a little bit crooked, sagging on one side. Two vertical, six-ribbed strap handles are applied on the shoulder, and, after being folded upon themselves, are attached on the upper part of the mouth to the rim. A thick coil is wound once around the mouth at mid-height.

## Comments and Comparanda

The vessel was probably made in third-century CE Syria and the features suggesting that attribution are the sagging, sack-shaped body; the distinctively-shaped handles; and the single coil of glass decorating the neck. Quite similar to the amphoriskos is a jar with two handles in the Corning Museum of Glass (62.1.12: [[Whitehouse 2001a]], p. 187, no. 733) and another in the Royal Ontario Museum ([[Hayes 1975]], p. 114, no. 436).

## Description

In-folded rim; conical mouth; cylindrical neck wider toward the body; squat globular body; flat bottom, standing on an applied base-ring. At the center of the bottom an annular pontil mark (W. 2.2, Th. 0.1 cm). A thick trail of glass is wound around, forming a ring at the middle of the neck. A pair of coil handles are applied on the shoulders, stretch to mid-neck height, where they bend and attach to the neck and the decorative trail. The surplus of the coil is folded over the upper surface of the handle.

## Comments and Comparanda

Small glass amphoras rendering in miniature the shape of large clay amphoras were quite popular and they were used as tableware for serving wine. This vessel belongs to a distinctive group of Syro-Palestinian glass table amphoras, appearing in four different types, which have been dated mainly to the fourth and fifth century CE ([[Stern 1977]], pp. 84–85). This particular vessel, due to its funnel mouth and tubular neck without a constriction at its base, is ascribed to type I, which is dated between the mid-third and mid-fourth centuries CE Among the vessels of this group the shape of the body varies greatly. On the basis of its free-blown, squat spherical body, the presence of a base, and the presence of a decorative coil halfway down neck, it is ascribed to type IB3a ([[Stern 1977]], pp. 84–85, fig. 2; [[Dusenbery 1971]], p. 24, fig. 39; [[La Baume 1973]], D94, plate 38:4). Quite similar but with conical base are the following parallels: [[Platz-Horster 1976]], p. 60, no. 110; [[Stern 1977]], pp. 84–85, type IB2a, fig. 2; [[Israeli 2003]], p. 262, no. 343; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 142, no. 196.

## Condition

Heavily weathered, with a resulting yellow-green iridescence. Heavily encrusted in areas around the neck and foot. Hair cracks visible on the shoulders. Part of one handle has been replaced with some other substance. The real color of the handles and the toe remains unclear due to the thick layer of iridescence that covers these areas.

## Description

Fire-polished rim; wide, conical mouth; elongated conical or carrot-shaped body, ending in a beaded toe. Two strap handles start on the shoulder and end at the top of the rim. A thick coil is wound six times around the neck. Faint remains of the trail of a fine thread which was wound 25 times around the vessel from the upper body to toe.

## Comments and Comparanda

Glass amphoriskoi with elongated and pointed body are a relatively well-known form for first-century CE flasks ([[Isings 1957]], pp. 77–78, form 60; [[Scatozza Höricht 1986]], p. 66, form 51; [[De Tommaso 1990]], p. 77, type 59bis) and 2003.417, albeit different in the shape of its mouth, is quite close to that production. It has been plausibly proposed that they render in a miniature fashion the shape of contemporaneous clay amphoras. In this case form Dressel 4 is the closest parallel, which was in use from ca. 70 BCE throughout the first century CE, for the transportation of wine ([[Dressel 1899]], forms 2–4 = [[Peacock and Williams 1986]], pp. 105–106, class 10; For an overview of this class and the relevant bibliography, see <https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/amphora_ahrb_2005/details.cfm?id=102> \[accessed 18 November 2022\]). In addition, the decoration of 2003.417 is very similar to that of a group of glass flasks with elongated conical or tear-drop pointed body with applied, spirally wound threads and/or coils, which are also a well-known form of first-century CE flasks; see [2003.415](#num), [2003.416](#num), and in particular comments on [2003.286](#num). A relatively close, painted parallel is in the Corning Museum of Glass (59.1.82a, b: [[Whitehouse 2001a]], p. 258, no. 853) as well as a larger parallel also dated to the first century CE (62.1.29: [[Whitehouse 1997a]], p. 169, no. 296).

In-folded, tubular, everted rim; long, slightly lopsided, cylindrical neck; sloping shoulder with smooth transition to the ovoid body; pushed-in, conical base; flat bottom. Slanting tooling marks are visible on the base. No pontil mark is visible. A thread is wound in a spiral ten times around neck. A thicker, flattened thread is wound once around the lower part of the neck. After the application of threads, two pairs of handles were added. One pair of coil handles extends from shoulder to rim, looped one time against the neck, forming two arches. A second, opposing pair of coil handles extends also from shoulder to rim and is looped twice against the neck, forming a longer arch from shoulder to mid–high neck and two, smaller arches on the upper part of the neck.

## Comments and Comparanda

Tall, multihandled flasks with a distinctively elongated neck decorated with a spirally wound fine thread and multiple coil handles applied to the shoulder and attached halfway up the neck, and occasionally pulled up to the rim, belong to a small group of vessels that has been proposed to be products of the same workshop that produced the kohl tubes in inland Palestine, in Galilee, or the Jordan valley ([[Stern 2001]], p. 270). For parallels see [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 150, no. 208; [[Stern 2001]], p. 308, no. 171; [[Israeli 2003]], p. 265, no. 351.

## Comments and Comparanda

Kohl tubes are widely distributed in the Syro-Palestinian region, found mostly in tombs dated between the middle of the fourth and sixth centuries CE ([[Barag 1970a]], pp. 175−177, types 12:2, 12:3, plate 39:2, 3; [[Dussart 1998]], pp. 173–175, types B.XIII.2211–2232; [[Gorin-Rosen and Katsnelson 2007]], pp. 36–42). The basic concept of the vessel is always the same: a glass tube bent to form a vessel with two parallel compartments. Variants with one, two, or even more tubes are known, with or without handles. Their content and use are evident because in some cases remains of kohl and/or metal or bone applicators were found in them ([[Seligman, Zias, and Stark 1996]], p. 50). This particular type with elaborate handles has been dated to the fifth century CE ([[Barag 1970a]], pp. 177−178, type 12:5–1, plate 39:5–1; [[Gorin-Rosen and Katsnelson 2007]], p. 42). Other comparanda include the following: [[Barag 1970a]], vol. 2, plate 39, type XII, variation of subtype 7; [[Dussart 1998]], p. 174, type B.XIII.222, plate 58:1, 2; [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], p. 483, no. 1320; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 267, no. 438.

## Description

The vessel comprise two glass tubes, each bent at the middle and fused together with the other one, forming a four-compartment body on a flat bottom. The tubes have in-folded, slightly everted rims. At the center of the bottom is a solid, circular pontil mark (W. 1.7 cm). A fine thread is wound spirally 21 times around body. On the four corners of the vessel a thick trail stretches from the bottom to the rim, looped eight to nine times against the body. A pair of vertical basket handles rise from the rims, bridged at the top by a third handle, perpendicular to them. At mid-height the handles are bridged with a pair of smaller basket handles placed on the opposite sides.

## Description

Horizontal rim with fire-polished lip; cylindrical body with folded, horizontal flange at top and bottom; flat, slightly concave bottom. No pontil mark is visible on the bottom.

Conical, lopsided lid. It is free-blown, like a small vessel with flaring fire-polished rim, wide neck widening toward the bulbous body, which was folded and pressed, forming a wide horizontal, slightly convex band. This band secured the lid on the opening of the vessel. The the rim of the lid is tapering, ending in a tubular tip.

## Comments and Comparanda

Inkwells in Roman times, atramentaria ([[Hilgers 1969]], s.v. “atramentarium,” pp. 39, 112), were predominantly made of metal and clay, but in the first century CE they were also rendered in glass. Three forms of glass inkwells have been identified: two with cylindrical body and one with short hemispherical body. Their use becomes evident from the narrow opening with fire-polished edge that is placed at the center of the horizontal upper surface of the vessel as in the clay and metal inkwells ([[Fünfschilling 2012]], pp. 194–195; [[Eckardt 2017]], pp. 53–107). The more widely distributed shorter and wider cylindrical form was probably produced in the west and the form was supplemented with three loop handles on the upper surface of the vase ([[Isings 1957]], p. 93, form 77). A slender, handleless cylindrical form is ascribed to eastern Mediterranean workshops ([[Whitehouse 1997a]], p. 199, no. 347 and particularly comments on no. 360; [[Israeli 2003]], p. 121, no. 118) ([2003.239](#num), [2003.240](#num)). This form was supplemented with lid, either biconical or cylindrical. A less widely distributed variant, rendered in clay as well ([[Broneer 1935]], pp. 72–73, fig. 17; [[Eckardt 2018]], pp. 55–57), has a hemispherical body and a seemingly flat or slightly convex upper surface with narrow fire-rounded rim at the center and one handle ([2003.378](#num), [2003.453](#num)). There are parallels from the eastern Mediterranean that date the form to the first–second centuries CE ([[Lightfoot 2013a]], pp. 426–427, figs. 3–4: [http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/249364](http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the–collection–online/search/249364); [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], pp. 187, 249, no. 752; [[Davidson 1952]], p. 101, no. 636, fig. 8; [[Antonaras 2022]], pp. 68–69, no. 443).

Free-blown and tooled, circular lid with an oval protuberance at the center of the upper surface. It is formed like a small vessel with a wide, cylindrical neck and bulbous body, then folded and pressed, forming a wide horizontal, slightly convex band. This band secured the lid on the opening of the vessel. It continues as a wide, cylindrical tube, mildly tapering toward its end. The end is broken, and its exact shape remains unknown, but a small, preserved part of it indicates that it was bent and protruding.

## Condition

Part of the rim replaced with painted plaster or gypsum. Little weathering and some incrustation.

## Description

Thick, slightly flaring rim; long, twisted, tubular body bearing seven ribs; a slight constriction, 1 cm below the rim, forms the short neck. The small, integral disk base does not allow the vessel to stand. A pair of small, curved, coil handles extend from upper body to over the rim.

## Comparanda Commentary

Thick unguentaria made of opaque glass, formed around a metal rod, appear both in a slender, cylindrical shape with twisted ribs and in a smaller, squat, jar-shaped variant with ribbed or smooth body. They had two tiny handles. They are usually in dark green, appearing black (2003.470, [2003.463](#num)), opaque turquoise ([2003.469](#num)), or blue ([2003.468](#num)) glass. They are dated provisionally between the fourth and the fifth centuries, and they are ascribed to the Syrian region ([[Abdul Hak 1965]], pp. 27–28, figs. 2–3; [[Barag 1975]], p. 30 n. 29). The majority of the kohl tubes bear spiraling ribs formed by twisting the vessel while it was still hot and malleable. A small group, dated to the seventh–eighth centuries CE, includes tubes with applied—i.e., trailed on—decoration either of the same color as the body or of opaque red and white glass (see comments on [2003.463](#num)). Based on tooling marks, it has been assumed that they were made by glass bead makers and not glassblowers ([[Stern 2001]], p. 78). They were possibly used as kohl containers.

## Condition

One handle missing. Little weathering and some incrustation.

## Description

Faint remains of a turquoise thread, which was wound three times around the rim, are noticeable. Body cylindrical; pad disk base. Some tooling marks on the underside of the base indicate that it was made with a thick coil of glass wound three times and flattened, forming a disk.

On the body, five rows of decoration. Each row consists of a pair of fine threads (currently appearing white due to weathering) which curve and intertwine, forming three conjoined ovals. At the center of each oval is a round blob of turquoise glass. The vessel is noticeably heavier compared to other glass vessels of similar size and shape.

## Comments and Comparanda

Small, tubular vessels, known as kohl tubes, are separated into two groups on the basis of their decoration. The majority bear spiraling ribs formed by twisting the vessel while it was still hot and malleable (on rod-formed kohl tubes with spiraled ribbed decoration see [2003.470](#num)). A much more concise group includes tubes that bear applied decoration, with just a few published examples, among which is 2003.463. Parallels include a vessel from the al-Sabah Collection, now in the Kuwait National Museum ([[Carboni 2001]], p. 294, no. 74); one from the Israel Museum, Jerusalem ([[Israeli 2003]], p. 381, no. 516), one in the Okayama Orient Museum ([[Taniichi 1987]], p. 90, no. 111, illustrated on p. 53), and one in the Corning Museum of Glass ([[Whitehouse 2014]], pp. 187–188, no. 931).

## Condition

Mended. Probably a pastiche: The neck seems to belong to another vessel and has been glued on the body of another. Iridescence on the exterior; in the grooves and in the interior, incrustation.

## Description

Cut-off rim; conical neck, tapering toward the body, covered with 12 vertical grooves. Horizontal shoulder; rectangular body, square in cross section; flat bottom. On the bottom a f the top side and two short oblique strokes flanking the central strokes in the middle of each side.

## Comments and Comparanda

Wheel-cutting and wheel-engraving were popular decorative techniques in Islamic glassware between the ninth and eleventh centuries, as numerous finds from various sites in Syria, Palestine, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, and Tunis prove. Six categories of cut and engraved objects are defined on the basis of the decoration: scratch-engraved, faceted, with disks and related motifs, with raised outlines, slant-cut, and linear. In the twelfth century cutting gradually goes out of fashion, replaced by enameling, the technique that prevailed during the next two centuries in Islamic glassware.

Cutting was employed mostly for the embellishment of colorless vessels of various forms, for example, bowls, bottles, goblets, and flasks, although colorful and even cameo vessels occur too. There are indications that quite similar products were made in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt ([[Kröger 1995]], pp. 116–175; [[Kröger 1999]], pp. 219–232; [[Carboni 2001]], pp. 71–136; [[Whitehouse 2001b]], pp. 155–161; [[Foy 2020]], pp. 85–98). For flasks with square or polygonal body see comments and comparanda for [79.AF.184.28](#cat). In addition, for flasks with cut decoration that are square in cross section, see comments and comparanda for [79.AF.184.42](#cat). Also, for similar prismatic flasks, cf. [[Whitehouse 2014]], pp. 73–74, nos. 727 and 728.

## Condition

Pastiche of two fragments. Covered with weathering and incrustation. Repaired break between the neck and the body. “Fake weathering” (resin and chunks of weathered glass) present on the neck to make it look like it goes with the body. Neck belongs to a different vessel, glued to the body in modern times. The feet probably were originally longer.

## Description

Round, vertical rim; cylindrical neck; four-sided body, square in cross section; wedge-shaped feet.

Deeply cut decoration. Deep horizontal groove along the middle of the body. Triangular, oblique strokes transect the body diagonally, forming a lozenge-shape motif. Two deep, triangular bevels on each corner, pointing to the top and bottom of the vessel, leaving a prunt along the central groove. Below the horizontal groove a deep bevel at the center of each side delineates four pyramidal, wedge-shaped feet.

## Comparanda

Molar flasks, named for the wedge-shaped feet reminiscent of the shape of the roots of a human tooth, and usually decorated with deep cut motifs, are typical for the entire Islamic world of the ninth–tenth centuries, unearthed more often in Egyptian sites. They were probably produced in several regions. They were used as containers for scented oils and perfumes. Examples include finds from Egypt (Fustat: [[Shindo 1992]], p. 185, nos. 6–11; [[Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001]], pp. 95–97, figs. 42–43); the Sinai Peninsula (Raya and al-Tur: [[Kawatoko 1996]], plate 37, no. 15, plate 40:7; [[Shindo 2003]], fig. 3: 8); Palestine ([[Hadad 2005]], pp. 45 and 172–173, no. 868); Syria ([[Lane 1937]], p. 66, fig. 10:E; [[Salam-Liebich 1978]], p. 146; [[Riis 1957]], p. 53, figs. 138–145, no. 140); Iraq (Samarra: [[Lamm 1928]], pp. 215–219); Iran (Susa: [[Kervran 1984]], fig. 8, no. 26; Nishapur: [[Kröger 1995]], pp. 135–137; Siraf: [[Whitehouse 1968]], p. 19); the Arabian Peninsula ([[Zarins et Zahrani 1985]], plate 18, no. 31); the East African coast ([[Chittick 1974]], fig. 154a); southeastern Asia ([[Swan Needell 2018]], plate 6, no. 71); Tunis (Sabra al-Mansuriyya: [[Foy 2020]], p. 84, no. 123). Most private collections possess some examples, including the Kuwait National Museum ([[Carboni 2001]], pp. 98–99, 124–127, nos. 27a–c, 2.28a–r); the Israel Museum ([[Brosh 2003]], p. 368, no. 503); the Erez Museum ([[Carboni and Whitehouse 2001]], p. 153, no. 67); Corning Museum of Glass ([[Whitehouse 2010]], pp. 67–68, 90, nos. 103–112, 138–139); the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York ([[Lamm 1930]], p. 165, plate 61, no. 11); Los Angeles County Museum of Art ([[von Saldern 1980b]], p. 164, nos. 161–162); Kunstpalast, Düsseldorf ([[von Saldern 1974]], p. 273, nos. 419–420); Museum für Islamische Kunst, Berlin ([[Kröger 1984]], pp. 176, 183–184, nos. 153, 162); Benaki Museum, Athens ([[Clairmont 1977]], pp. 91–93, nos. 304–309, plate XVII); Khalili Collection ([[Goldstein et al. 2005]], pp. 156–157, nos. 176–177).

## Comments and Comparanda

Vessels with square or polygonal body, usually mold-blown, first appear in the Umayyad period, but they become quite common in the Abbasid–Fatimid periods. The shape was very convenient for packing and probably evolved for this reason. Many sites in the Syro-Palestinian region, but also in Iraq, Egypt, and East Africa, have yielded finds dated between the eighth and tenth centuries: Pella ([[Edwards et al. 1990]], p. 86, fig. 13:8); Beirut ([[Jennings 2004/5]], p. 214); al-Mina ([[Lane 1937]], p. 65, fig. 10:H); Seleucia ([[Negro Ponzi 1970–71]], p. 79, no. 40); Jerusalem ([[Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929]], p. 98, plate XXI:2); Beit She’an ([[Hadad 2005]], pp. 39–40, nos. 696–703, wherein all previous bibliography is cited); Yoqne’am ([[Lester 1996]], pp. 206–208, fig. XVII.6:1–8, photo XVIII.1. no. 38); Ramla ([[Gorin-Rosen and Katsnelson 2005]], p. 112, no. 41; [[Pollak 2007]], p. 126, fig. 11:7); Fustat ([[Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001]], pp. 66–67, forms 34a–e, f; [[Shindo 1992]], fig. IV-6–15:7–11); Kom el-Dikka ([[Shindo 2004]], p. 33, fig. 1:12–13); Raya ([[Shindo 2004]], pp. 51–53, plate 12:13); Soba ([[Morrison 1991]], p. 257, no. 79, fig. 147:79); Iraq ([[Hunein 1983]], pp. 248–250, fig. 29); ‘Ana ([[Bamber 1988]]: 124, fig. 53:10); Samarra ([[Lamm 1928]], p. 24, nos. 79, 87); Iran ([[Lamm 1935]], p. 9, plate II:E–N, P; [[Kröger 1995]], p. 150, no. 201); Tunisia ([[Foy 2020]], pp. 75, 78, fig. 31, type Sb11); Manda island on the coast of Kenya ([[Morrison 1984]], p. 171, fig. 138:b); Mafia in East Africa ([[Morrison 1987]], p. 303, fig. 4:2). The latest-known bottle of this type was discovered in the Crusader fortress of Montfort (Qal’at al-Qurein), dated to the thirteenth century ([[Dean 1927]], p. 40, fig. 47).

Mended. Repaired break at the neck. XRF suggests pieces could go together, and visual inspection supports this, although the neck and the body present slightly different weathering. Iridescence on the exterior; in the grooves and on the interior, incrustation.

## Description

Flattened, vertical rim; cylindrical neck. Horizontal shoulder; four-sided body, square in cross section; flat bottom. On the bottom an annular pontil scar (W. 0.8 cm) is visible. Two sides bear at the center three slightly oblique grooves, dropping to the left. The other two sides are covered with an everted triangle, one short vertical stroke at the center of the top and two short, oblique downward strokes at the center of the sides. The strokes on the left side are placed slightly higher than the ones on the right side of the triangle. Along the bottom, three straight grooves. Thick bottom and lower part of the body form the trapezoid interior of the vessel.

## Condition

Exterior partly iridescent; interior covered with incrustation. Consists of two pieces, rim neck and body piece. Probably a pastiche. The body is ground and flattened around the neck, probably in modern times, so that it could fit with a neck piece.

## Description

a\) Flaring end, in-folded and flattened, forming a horizontal flange that considerably shrinks the width of the opening. Short, cylindrical neck.

b\) Globular body decorated with 20 deep vertical ribs arranged all around; mildly convex bottom. On the bottom a scar, probably annular pontil scar (W. ca. 1.3, Th. 0.1 cm). Signs of a diaphragm at the bottom of the neck, which was later ground flat.

## Comparanda

A very close parallel was in a private collection ([[Loudmer and Kevorkian 1985]], p. 224, no. 546), dated in the seventh–eighth centuries CE. Various forms bearing mold-blown ribbing have been published from Fustat, Egypt, dated in the eighth–ninth centuries CE ([[Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001]], pp. 70–73, form 35a–p). For a jar with finer, mold-blown vertical ribbing dated in the eighth–tenth century, in the Israel Museum see [[Brosh 2003]], p. 353, no. 471.

Fire-polished, rounded rim; conical neck, constricted at its base; pear-shaped body, slightly raised base-ring; flat bottom. Slightly lopsided neck. The body is covered with mold-blown honeycomb pattern of six horizontal rows of hexagonal cells. Blown on a three-part mold with two vertical parts and one for the base, with a slightly raised circle at the periphery of the bottom rendering a ring-base.

## Comparanda

Mold-blown and dip mold–blown glass vessels are present in various periods of Islamic glassware ([[Whitehouse 2001c]], pp. 81–83). Honeycomb pattern appears in Islamic glassware on jugs, juglets, bowls, and jars in the tenth–eleventh centuries (e.g., [[Brosh 2003]], pp. 356–357, nos. 479–482) and in the twelfth–thirteenth centuries (e.g., [[Whitehouse 2014]], pp. 97–102, nos. 771–782), and some of them were probably made in Iran ([[von Saldern 1974]], pp. 194, 197–199, 204, nos. 290–291, 293–294, 296, 306; [[Carboni and Whitehouse 2001]], pp. 98–99, nos. 24–25).

## Condition

Intact; iridescent sheen on the exterior and dark accretion on the interior.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; relatively wide, cylindrical neck; bulbous body; slightly concave bottom. The body is covered with mold-blown honeycomb pattern in twelve rows of hexagonal cells.

## Comparanda

The mold-blown honeycomb pattern appears in the third and fourth centuries CE, on Syrian sprinklers like [2003.335](#num). The tint and the overall quality of the glass of 2003.338, however, does not fit with that of Late Roman products; it rather seems closer to Islamic glassware. Mold-blown flasks with wide neck and globular body, decorated with the honeycomb pattern, among other motifs, are also known from the Abbasid and Fatimid periods. See examples from Fustat ([[Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001]], p. 76, forms 36-f, 36-g) and Egypt ([[Clairmont 1977]]: for the decoration see p. 64, no. 204; for the shape p. 65, no. 209).

## Comparanda

Conical bowls are a very popular shape among Islamic glassware. They occur either undecorated like this example, or with mold-blown motifs, such as ribs or crosshatching (cf. [[von Saldern 1974]], pp. 207–209, nos. 312–317; [[Kröger 1995]], p. 93, no. 130). Parallels include finds from Fustat ([[Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001]], pp. 23–24, 26 form 2e, or 5b) and museum collections, such as Kunstpalast Düsseldorf ([[von Saldern 1974]], p. 352, nos. 349–350), and the Corning Museum of Glass ([[Whitehouse 2014]], p. 33, nos. 638–639). The thickened rim and the flat bottom link this bowl to a form of bowls with vertical sides that have this type of rim and bottom; they are dated to the tenth century, e.g., [[Kröger 1995]], p. 45, nos. 11–12.

## Comparanda

Shallow bowls and bottles made of sealing-wax red glass, occasionally with a reddish-brown tint and dark brown or black veins running through it, have been plausibly proposed to have been made in Palestine, and they are dated in the eighth–ninth centuries CE ([[Carboni and Whitehouse 2001]], pp. 16–17; [[Brosh 2004]]). They have been found in excavations at Hama ([[Riis 1957]], pp. 48, 61, fig. 178), Jerusalem ([[Brosh 2004]], pp. 54–55), and Corinth ([[Davidson 1952]], pp. 107–109, 112, 116, 121, nos. 694, 699, 730, 759, 802, 807) and they are also noted in museum collections, namely in Eretz Israel Museum ([[Brosh 2004]], p. 54; [[Carboni and Whitehouse 2001]], p. 17, fig. 2); the Kuwait National Museum ([[Carboni 2001]], p. 153, nos. 3.3.a–h); the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford ([[Brosh 2004]], p. 54), previously in the Smith Collection ([[[Glass from the Ancient World]{.underline} 1957]], p. 201, no. 398), and previously in the Benzian Collection ([[Benzian 1994]], p. 105, no. 195).

## Condition

Part of the tail is missing. The flask is cracked. Heavy weathering gives the entire ensemble a brown and whitish coloring.

## Description

Flask in the shape of a quadruped with spread legs, as in movement, with a basket on its back carrying a flask.

The flask has flaring, in-folded rim; short, wide neck; globular body; and concave bottom. The rim was pushed on its upper surface, forming a groove that gives the impression of an applied thick coil around it.

The legs of the animal are fashioned from a single, originally rectangular, flattened mass of glass that was folded and bent at its four ends. Above that, a flattened discoid lump was applied and encircled by a flattened trail pinched in 12 places all around, on which the lower trail of the basket stands. The flask was then added onto this base, and the basket was formed around it. The basket consists of a two-tiered lattice: 12 turquoise folds comprise the upper row and 12 yellowish folds the lower. At that point, the neck, head, and the greenish ears were added. At the center of the animal’s belly an annular pontil mark (W. 1.4, Th. 0.5 cm) is visible.

## Comments and Comparanda

Many perfume vases of this type—representing a flask mounted on an animal—are preserved. They are usually referred to as camels, probably because of the long neck, although no sign of a haunch is rendered. In addition, these glass animals usually appear with curved elongated lumps of glass on the top of the head, that can easily be interpreted as long ears, identifying them thus with donkeys, which were a very widespread pack animal in that time and the region.

They were made in Syrian and Mesopotamian workshops under Sassanian and Islamic rule ([[Jenkins 1986]], p. 11).

## Condition

Most of the object is covered with an iridescent layer of weathering. A small hole at the lower part of the body. There are repairs, and parts of the glass trail of the basket are missing .

## Description

In-folded, tubular, flaring rim; long, cylindrical neck; globular body; flat, slightly concave bottom.

Body and head made of yellowish glass. Horns and tail made of dark green glass.

The basket is formed by two rows of trails curved ten times in zigzags. The lower row is made of yellowish glass and the upper of dark greenish glass.

A lump of glass was flattened into a roughly square shape and held by a pontil. To form the legs of the animal, the four corners were stretched out, pressed, and curved. On the upper surface of this mass a thick disk was attached, around which was added a pinched band of glass. A trail was attached to this band, forming ten zigzags. Above the tips of these zigzags, another zigzagged trail was added, forming an open-shaped conical basket in which a vessel was placed and attached. A curved band of glass added at the front end was pinched and tooled at its upper end to form the long neck and elongated head of the animal. A band attached to the upper part of the head, covered with horizontal pinching, forms the long, back-turned ears of the animal, probably a donkey. Finally, a small coil of glass bent into a small ring forms the short tail of the animal.

The vessel currently sitting in the basket is not the original: a layer of greenish substance is visible under and around it, which was used to connect it to the animal in modern times.

Annular pontil mark (Diam. 1.3 cm) is visible on the underside of the body.
