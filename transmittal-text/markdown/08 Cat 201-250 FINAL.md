## Condition

Severely weathered; repaired with small fills near the rim. The surface is iridescent and pitted.

## Description

The rim is vertical and flattened. On the exterior of the rim and 0.5 cm beneath it there is a tooled horizontal ridge that marks the transition to a wide, cylindrical neck, which tapers toward the body. Mold-blown, rectangular body; rounded shoulder; rests on a flat bottom.

Identical relief, mold-blown decoration appears on all four sides of the body: at the center of each side there is a six-pointed star. At the upper two corners of the side there are two hardly noticeable reliefs, probably circular blobs, and on the lower two corners triangular reliefs. The relief is not crisp and it is mostly faded. On the bottom is visible a scar of a solid pontil (1.4 × 1 cm).

## Comparanda

This flask belongs to a small group of square mold-blown vessels, apparently made in the eastern Mediterranean, decorated mostly with vegetal motifs; their date remains unclear and they have been ascribed either to the Byzantine (fourth–seventh centuries) or the early Islamic (eighth–ninth centuries) periods: {Jenkins 1986}, p. 17, nos. 11–12 (no. 11 bears identical decoration), dated between the seventh and ninth century CE; {Bauer 1938}, p. 544, no. 100, plate CXLB, fig. 30 from a Byzantine (fourth–seventh centuries) context; {Lane 1937}, p. 68, fig. 12.H, from a nonstratified context; {Oliver 1980}, p. 131, no. 230; {Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 135, nos. 644–645, dated either to the period between the fifth and seventh centuries or between the ninth and twelfth centuries CE; {Goldstein et al. 2005}, p. 44, nos. 24–26, dated between the fifth and seventh centuries; {Ratković-Bukovčan 2004}, p. 94, no. 51.

## Description

In-folded, tubular rim; flaring mouth; short, cylindrical neck, strongly constricted at its base; spherical body; flat base. At the center of the bottom is the straight mold seam. On the body are five mold-blown rows consisting of eight squares each. At the center of each square there is a boss. Irregularities on the pattern are visible.

## Comparanda

Vessels with a diaphragm formed at the bottom of the neck are known as sprinklers or dropper flasks due to the fact that the diaphragm allowed only individual drops of the fluid content to flow through it. In addition to flasks, jars and amphoriskoi were occasionally finished as sprinklers. They are often decorated with mold-blown and cut motifs, pinched fins, and applied trails, and they mostly appear in the Levant, Syria, eastern Palestine, and Mesopotamia, indicating a production site in the region, although a workshop seems to have been operating in Cologne too, one that specialized in snake-thread decoration. Sprinklers appeared in the third century CE and continued in the fourth and probably into the early fifth century CE ({Stern 2001}, pp. 152–153. On other sprinklers see {Antonaras 2012}, pp. 91–93, nos. 106–110, esp. pp. 109–110, no. 108, wherein further bibliography).

## Condition

Fully preserved; small fill on the rim; some iridescence in the interior. The seam mark indicates that this piece was blown in a mold of two vertical, hemispherical parts.

## Description

Slightly flaring, in-folded, tubular rim; short, cylindrical neck; oval body, resting on a flat base. Along the bottom the straight seam between the two parts of the mold is visible. The entire body is decorated with mold-blown relief designs, namely: 28 elongated tongues cover the upper, and twenty-nine petals the lower body. The central part of the body is covered by a tendril scroll, flanked by a groove with raised ridges above and below. Two vertical, coil handles have been applied to the shoulder and drawn up to the mouth. One handle is dark gray with purple striations, and the second is purple with dark gray striations.

## Comments and Comparanda

There are several published mold-blown flasks decorated with a tendril scroll around the body that is flanked by tongues and petals, decoration which appears in at least three different variants. They have either one or two handles, and it has been suggested ({Stern 1995}, p. 152) that they represent a miniature version of glass amphoras like the ones signed by the famous glassblower Ennion (see {Kunina 1997}, p. 273, nos. 109–110; {Lightfoot 2014}, pp. 74, 127, nos. 3, 35).

## Description

The seam mark indicates that this amphoriskos was made in a mold of two vertical, hemispherical parts. Edges of mold sections not carefully aligned. Slightly flaring, in-folded tubular rim; short, cylindrical neck; spherical body resting on a flat base. Along the bottom the straight seam between the two parts of the mold is visible. The entire body is decorated with mold-blown relief designs; namely, 22 elongated tongues cover the upper and lower body. The central part of the body is covered by a frieze of twelve Xs with thickened intersection point, bordered by a groove above and below. Two blue vertical coil handles with a few white striations have been applied to the shoulder and drawn up to the mouth at 90 degrees from the seam.

## Comments and Comparanda

There are several published mold-blown flasks decorated with a central band filled with Xs around the central part of their body and flanked by tongues and petals; this decoration appears in a number of variants. They have either one or two handles, and it has been convincingly suggested ({Stern 1995}, p. 151) that they were used as aryballoi, containing oil used to clean the body of the athletes, as is indicated by the metal rings preserved on the handles of some of them, like the one in the Princeton University Art Museum ({Antonaras 2012}, p. 78, no. 78). For direct parallels see {Lightfoot 1989}, p. 25, no. 8; {Stern 1995}, pp. 150–153, nos. 53–58; {Froehner 1903}, no. 1124, p. 156, plate 202.3–4; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 78, no. 78.

## Description

Flaring, in-folded, and flattened tubular rim,; cylindrical neck, mildly constricted at its base; convex, sloping shoulder; cylindrical body, with convex lower part; flat bottom. Two opposed, bifurcated strap handles of translucent dark blue glass applied on the shoulders, drawn upward, bent, and attached halfway up neck.

The mold-blown decoration consists of a frieze of 16 down-turned tongues in raised outline with raised darts between them on the shoulder, and a frieze of 24 upturned identical tongues and darts on the lower part of the body. The central, cylindrical part of the body is bordered on the upper part by a raised ridge and a groove and on the lower part by a concave band. The central part of the body is decorated with a wreath made of grape and ivy twigs ending in olive tree twigs at the front. On each mold section a different plant is depicted, arranged horizontally, tip to tip, from left to right: (1) ivy branch(es) with four pairs of trefoil leaves pointing toward the center, bundled at the center of the panel with three oblique ring bands/filets; (2) grape branch(es) with four pairs of multifoil leaves pointing toward the center, bundled at the center of the panel with three oblique rings/filets; (3) two probably stylized olive branches with two pairs of single-pointed leaves alternating with round fruits, each branch ending toward the center to an oblique, oval thickening. On the bottom are three raised concentric rings surrounding a central boss, the outer ring forming a base-ring 3 cm in diameter.

## Comments and Comparanda

There are several published mold-blown flasks decorated with a central band that is filled with floral sprays flanked by tongues and petals, decoration which appears in a number of variants. It has been suggested that the concept of the design can be connected to Aristeas, a famous first-century CE glassblower ({Harden 1944}, pp. 84–86; {Stern 1995}, p. 166). This vessel is a unique example with two handles from a well-known type of mold-blown vessel, all of which are finished as jugs. They comprise a quite widespread type ({Harden 1944}, pp. 84–86, 292; {Stern 1995}, pp. 116–168, nos. 75–77). Several finds originate from the Syro-Palestinian region, where they were quite probably produced {Harden 1944}, p. 84–85, 292; {Israeli 1964}, pp. 36–37, no. 4b, figs. 6–7) and Cyprus ({Vessberg 1952}, p. 130, plate VI, no. 20; {Karageorghis 1988}, p. 799, 801, fig. 16). They are known also from Austria {Harden 1944}, p. 85, no. d; {Czurda-Ruth 1979}, pp. 144–145, no. 1055, plates 9, 22) and Spain ({Price 1973}, p. 68, no. 2), and few more with unrecorded findspots ({Auth 1976}, p. 66, no. 59; {Oliver 1980}, p. 62, no.55; {Bomford 1976}, no. 42). Since the find from Magdalensburg ({Czurda-Ruth 1979}, pp. 144–145, no. 1055, plates 9, 22) is dated before 45 CE the whole series is dated before that point. This earlier date is also supported by the fact that opaque glass went out of fashion by the 60s.

One bifurcated strap handle with an elbow made of two layers of glass, dark blue on the upper side and turquoise on the lower, has been applied on the shoulder and drawn up to the lip, where it forms a vertical tab.

The mold-blown decoration consists of a frieze of 29 down-turned flutes on the shoulder and a frieze of 29 upturned identical flutes on the lower part of the body. The central, cylindrical part of the body is bordered on the upper part by a raised ridge and on the lower part by two ridges. The ivy frieze on the central part conceals the seams of the mold. On each mold section is a pair of horizontal twigs with two pairs of heart-shaped ivy leaves intertwined in a knot at the center of the panel. On the bottom are three raised concentric rings surrounding a central boss, the outer ring forming a base-ring 2.4 cm in diameter.

## Comments and Comparanda

This piece belongs to a variant of a well-known type of mold-blown vessel, all of which are finished as jugs, except of [2003.313](#num), which is an amphoriskos ({Harden 1944}, pp. 84–86, 292; {Stern 1995}, pp. 116–168, nos. 75–77 with all bibliography). Several finds originate from the Syro-Palestinian region, where they were quite probably produced {Harden 1944}, pp. 84–85, 292; {Israeli 1964}, pp. 36–37, nos. 4a–b, figs. 6–7). Most of them are decorated with an open wreath of ivy, grape, and olive. This particular variant bears a continuous frieze of ivy spays.

## Description

Rounded, fire-polished, flaring rim; short, cylindrical neck; rounded, sloping shoulder; hexagonal body tapering toward the bottom; flat hexagonal bottom bisected by the mold seam. Two coil handles applied on the shoulder, drawn upward, and attached on the upper part of the neck. The handles are placed adjacent to the seam.

On the shoulder, six lunettes in raised outline and a tendril that stems from their side and stretches above them. On the body six oblong panels framed by a double ridge at the top and a single ridge at the three other sides of each panel. One continuous seam around body and underside of base between panels. Each half of the mold consisted of three panels of equal width, and the motifs on each panel are separated by a ridge. One part of the mold has a palm frond at the central panel flanked by panels with scrolls facing toward it. In the central panel of the other half of the mold are two ivy leaves flanked by panels with scrolls facing toward them. The upper part of the scrolls of each part are slightly different. In total, four panels bear scrolls and on the upper part a lunette with an X-shaped cross; one panel bears ivy leaves and on the upper part a plant with vertical stalk and two pairs of downcurved, elongated leaves; one panel bears a palm frond and on the upper part are three dots. A tendril stems from the side of the lunettes and extends over them. It stems on the right side of the central panels and on the left side of the side ones forming loose heart-shaped motifs.

Lunettes: (1) X / handle; (2) three dots; (3) X; (4) X / handle; (5) cross; (6) X.

Body panels: (1) scroll facing right; (2) palm frond with 10 pairs of leaves; (3) scroll facing right; (4) scroll facing left; (5) two ivy leaves pointing to the upper and lower ends of the panel; (6) scroll facing left.

## Comments and Comparanda

These hexagonal flasks are known in at least four different variants, which are distinguished by the arrangement and the themes of the decorative motifs. The form derives from a larger form of hexagonal bottles made by the famous glassblower Ennion, who probably drew inspiration for this form from architecture, likely either a shrine or a covered alter possibly of Dionysus since the vegetation on them is associated with that god and his retinue ({Lehrer 1979}, p. 9., plate 3, nos. 1–4; {Lightfoot 2012}, pp. 84–86, nos. 9–10). The only exact parallel, made of yellowish brown glass, is in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem ({Israeli 2011}, pp. 54–55). For parallels with similar but not identical arrangement of the motifs, see {Auth 1976}, pp. 66–67, no. 60; {Matheson 1980}, p. 51, no. 129; {Stern 1995}, pp. 156–157, no. 63 (second variant of the form, although the motifs are not exactly described, as per {von Saldern et al. 1974}, p. 158, no. 439); {Stern 2001}, p. 121, no. 50; {Whitehouse 2001a}, pp. 44–45, no. 515; {Weinberg 1992}, pp. 125–126, no. 98; {3000 Jahre Glaskunst}, p. 78, no. 257; {Israeli 2011}, pp. 48–55; cf. also {Ravagnan 1994}, p. 33, no. 25, color plate III, a vessel with different motifs.

Intact.

## Description

In-folded, flattened, flaring, tubular rim; short, cylindrical neck; elongated oval, pointed body. The body of the vessel is purple, with the exception of a part of the rim and neck, which are made of greenish glass, due to a small layer of greenish glass that was possibly accidentally left on the tip of the blowpipe. The body was rolled on white blobs of glass before its insertion in the mold and the formation of twenty horizontal, mold-blown ridges from neck to base. Two blue strap handles are applied on the shoulder, drawn up and out to attach the rim, and the end of the band was folded back. The upper part of the mold seams are partly covered by the handles.

## Comparanda

There are several mold-blown miniature glass amphoras, all of them dated to the second half of the first century CE. They embody three different forms of contemporaneous clay amphoras. The first variant, to which [2003.305](#num) belongs, has tall slender body; the second, to which 2003.304 belongs, has an ovoid body that turns abruptly inward, to a pointed end; and the third has conical body with circular flat base. There are several variations of these three basic forms, indicating that this popular shape was produced in a number of workshops in the eastern Mediterranean and possibly in the west as well ({Stern 1995}, pp. 157–159, nos. 64–67).

## Description

In-folded, flaring rim; concave neck; ovoid body; flat base bisected by the mold seam. Two opposing coil handles are attached to the underside of the rim and are drawn down to the shoulder, where they are left floating, not attached to it. Handles positioned over the mold seam. Vessel shaped like a miniature amphora encased in a wicker basket. The basket ends on the shoulder at a rope-like thickening and consists of eight and thirteen rows, on the upper and lower part, respectively, divided by a central wreath of eight pairs of laurel leaves alternating with laurel berries around the middle of the basket. On one side of the vessel the leaves point to the right, and on the other side they point to the left.

## Comments and Comparanda

This flask is product of a Syro-Palestinian glass workshop that made handles in an unusual way, not adhering the lower attachment of the handle to the wall of the vessel. This peculiarity gave it the name the “Workshop of the Floating Handles” in the bibliography. Technically it is closely related to Ennion’s and Aristeas’s workshops in Sidon, dated to the first half of the first century CE. Ten forms of mold-blown vessels, quite diverse among themselves, have been identified as products of this workshop: miniature amphoras, bulbous, bag-shaped, lenticular, and six-sided flasks, more peculiar flasks in the shapes of an acorn, a shell, a ball, and head-shaped jugs. In addition, they produced free-blown vessels as well ({Stern 1995}, pp. 86–91). For this particular shape see {Israeli 1964}, p. 39, no. 8a, b (juglets, not amphoriskos); {von Saldern 1968}, p. 16, no. 34; {Kunina 1973}, pp. 111–112, fig. 13; {Kunina 1997}, p. 268, no. 94; {Auth 1976}, p. 68, no. 63; {Matheson 1980}, pp. 50–51, no. 128; {3000 Jahre Glaskunst}, p. 78, nos. 252, 253; {Stern 1995}, p. 154, no. 59; {Mandruzzato and Marcante 2007}, p. 58, no. 17 = {Calvi 1968}, p. 105, no. 246, plate 16:4.

## Description

Flaring, in-folded, partly flattened rim; lopsided ovular body, wider at the points where the handles were applied. Short conical neck or mouth, ovoid body, flat base. Two coil handles are applied to the underside of the rim, drawn down to shoulder, and cut off, left floating, not attached to the body. Handles are positioned over the mold seam. Vessel shaped like a miniature amphora encased in a wicker basket. The mold ended at the beginning of the neck. The vertical seam between the two parts of the mold is not visible along the body but s clearly visible along the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

It should be noted that the lower end of the handle is cut off, but it is not pressed into a disc as is the case in other products of this workshop, the “Workshop of the Floating Handles” (e.g., {Stern 1995}, p. 154, no. 59). For the form and the workshop, see comments on [2003.309](#num).

Two bands with herringbone, the upper facing to the left and the lower facing to the right, divide it into three parts. Flat base bisected by mold seam.

## Comments and Comparanda

The vessel renders the shape of a miniature amphora encased in a wicker basket in a similar fashion to the two examples in the JPGM collection produced by the Workshop of the Floating Handles, [2003.309](#num) and [2003.310](#num). The single published close parallel is held by Wheaton College, in Norton, Massachusetts ({Dusenbery 1971}, p. 14, no. 11, fig. 8).

## Description

In-folded, flaring rim; short, cylindrical neck; lentoid body; small, flat, rectangular base. Two bluish coil handles are applied on the shoulder, drawn upward, and attached to the underside of the rim and top of neck. Handles positioned over mold seams. Raised, mold-blown decoration on each side of the body, consisting of a large, six-petaled rosette surrounded by a wide band filled with a continuous scrolled tendril. At the meeting point of the two halves there is a wide, slightly convex band with a central rib that conceals the seam bordered by two raised ridges and stops at the border of the rectangular bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

Mold-blown lenticular flasks decorated with a rosette at the center of each side are known in four variants. They are mostly decorated with six-petaled rosettes, one with seven-spoked star, and one with five-petaled rosette. The distribution of the parallels, which were unearthed in the eastern Mediterranean, indicates that the production site of these flasks was also situated in that region dated to the first century CE ({Stern 1995}, pp. 154–156, nos. 60–61; {Stern 2001}, pp. 52–53).

Neck and body blown in a two-part mold of two vertical sections. Edges of mold not very carefully aligned. One continuous mold seam around body and base extends onto either side of neck and follows the line of vertical ribs on body.

## Description

In-folded, tubular, slightly flaring rim; cylindrical neck; the spherical body is covered by 17 vertical ribs, and stands on a flat bottom. An opaque white bifurcated strap handle has been applied on the shoulder and drawn up to the lip, with projecting thumb-rest tab above. Handle placed so that it is not adjacent to the seam. An opaque red striation runs along the interior surface of the handle, and some black inclusions are visible in it as well.

## Comments and Comparanda

There are several published melon-shaped jugs with vertical ribbing that belong to various molds, and those with firm archaeological data are dated to the second half of the first century CE. This form was circulating around the Black Sea coast and in the eastern Mediterranean, where it apparently was made, and it has not been spotted in western sites ({Stern 1995}, pp. 149–150). For direct parallels see {Arakelian, Tiratzian, and Khachatrian 1969}, pp. 57, 58, nos. 116, 118; {Kunina 1973}, pp. 123–124, fig. 18 = {Kunina 1997}, p. 280, no. 139; {Stern 1995}, pp. 149–151, nos. 50–51.

## Description

Cut-off, rough, slightly uneven, flaring rim; deep hemispherical body; small, slightly concave bottom. No pontil mark is visible on the bottom. The body is covered with a mold-blown honeycomb pattern comprising four rows of cells.

## Comments and Comparanda

Bowls featuring honeycomb pattern on their walls are a relatively widespread form among dip mold–blown vessels, that is, vessels which were first blown in a small and shallow mold and then further expanded by free-blowing. They are found throughout the Roman Empire, and several regions have been proposed to be their production sites, including western parts of the empire, the Black Sea region, Syria, and Egypt ({Hayes 1975}, p. 147; {Barkóczi 1971}, p. 83; {Dusenbery 1971}, p. 16). Usually there is a band of vertical ribs below the rim and below that is the web of hexagonal cells, which may be distorted due to the production technique. In addition, in some cases the honeycomb pattern is supplemented by concentric circles, applied blobs, or a rosette at the center of the bottom. Published examples include the following: {Harden 1936}, p. 165, no. 472, plate XVI; {Isings 1957}, p. 133, form 107a; {Fremersdorf 1961}, pp. 57–58, plate 113; {Barkóczi 1971}, p. 72, figs. 2–10; {Dusenbery 1971}, pp. 15–16, no. 15, fig. 12; {Auth 1976}, p. 85; {Goethert-Polaschek 1977}, p. 62, form 50, no. 237; {Weinberg 1988}, pp. 79–80, fig. 4-38: 350; {Foy 1995}, p. 200, form 13e, nos. 84–91, plate 10; {Golofast 2001}, pp. 126–127, drawings 81:11, 15–20; {Whitehouse 2001a}, pp. 110–113, nos. 606, 610; {Lazar 2003}, p. 121, form 3.10.3, fig. 35; {Antonaras 2017}, p. 64, form 14 (wherein further parallels are cited).

## Condition

Intact.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; tall, cylindrical body tapering toward the pushed-in, conical base; concave bottom. The body and the base are covered with twisted dip mold–blown ribs. An annular pontil mark (W. 2.2, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda:

This particular shape of beaker is quite rare if not unique among dip mold–blown vessels, that is, vessels which were first blown in a small and shallow mold and then further expanded by free-blowing. For a similar body shape with different base shape see {Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 147, no. 661. Spirally winding trails around the body were also used to give a very similar appearance to beakers, such as {Vessberg 1952}, p. 123, B.II.β, plate IV:11.

Fully preserved. A fracture on the neck and shoulder; faint layer of iridescence on the exterior and reddish incrustation in the interior.

## Description

In-folded, tubular rim; conical mouth; cylindrical neck with a slight constriction at its base; biconical body ending in a small, convex bottom. A thick turquoise coil has been wound three times under the bottom, forming a base disk. On the body are visible faint, dip mold–blown ribs, slanting from left to right. In addition, ten deep, vertical indentations are around the body from shoulder to bottom. Two turquoise coil handles start on the shoulder and end at mid-neck height.

Small glass amphoras rendering in miniature the shape of large clay amphoras were quite popular, and they were used as tableware for serving wine. This vessel belongs to a distinctive group of Syro-Palestinian glass table amphoras, appearing in four different types, which have been dated to the fourth and fifth centuries CE ({Stern 1977}, pp. 84–85). This particular vessel, due to its tall, tubular neck, which is constricted at its base, is ascribed to type III. Like the majority of examples of this type, it is dip mold–blown, with spiraling ribbing and elongated indentations along the body. On the basis of its long, conical body, the presence of a base, and the absence of a decorative coil halfway down neck it is ascribed to type IIIB1b ({Stern 1977}, pp. 84–85, fig. 3). The findspots indicate that these may have been produced in Palestine, possibly beginning in the first half of the fourth century CE ({Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 37, type 10.5 (variant); {Auth 1976}, p. 131, no. 164; {Bomford 1976}, no. 164; {Oliver 1980}, p. 124, no. 218; {Stern 2001}, pp. 146–149, nos. 100–101).

Vessels like 2003.429, which were first blown in a small and shallow mold and then further expanded by free-blowing, that is, dip mold–blown, mainly appear in the fourth and early fifth centuries CE ({Stern 2001}, pp. 27, 133–134; {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 18–19).

## Description

In-folded, tubular rim; flaring mouth; short, cylindrical neck; flat shoulders; globular body; flat, slightly concave bottom. The body is covered with dip mold–blown ribs, slanting from right at the top to left toward the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

Globular, free- and mold-blown flasks, usually with taller necks, are a very widespread form ({Isings 1957}, pp. 119–120, form 101), which appeared equally in the west European Roman provinces and the eastern Mediterranean as well from the late third century, and then remained in use throughout the fourth and up to the early fifth century. This particular ribbed example is dip mold–blown, that is, it was initially blown in a small, ribbed mold and then expanded to the final dimensions by further free-blowing and rotating. For a recent overview of examples from western Europe and the Balkans, dated predominantly to the fourth century CE, see {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 99–100, form 51b. For two very similar, purplish flasks, one with equally wide and short neck in Corning Museum of Glass see {Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 122, no. 624 and another with a taller neck in the Yale University Art Gallery, see {Matheson 1980}, p. 83, no. 224.

## Description

In-folded, tubular, flaring rim; wide, conical mouth; cylindrical neck, wider toward the body. A constriction at the transition from the neck to the body forms a diaphragm. The globular body is covered with 22 well-defined, S-shaped mold-blown ribs. The vessel stands on a flat, slightly concave bottom. Annular pontil mark (W. 2.4, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.

## Comparanda

Vessels with a diaphragm formed at the bottom of the neck are known as sprinklers or dropper flasks due to the fact that the diaphragm allowed only individual drops of the fluid content to flow through it. In addition to flasks, jars and amphoriskoi were occasionally finished as sprinklers. They are often decorated with mold-blown and cut motifs, pinched fins, and applied trails, and they mostly appear in the Levant, Syria, eastern Palestine, and Mesopotamia, indicating a production site in the region, although a workshop seems to have been operating in Cologne that specialized in snake-thread decoration. Sprinklers appeared in the third century CE, and continued in the fourth and even probably into the early fifth century CE ({Stern 2001}, pp. 152–153). Other sprinklers see {Antonaras 2012}, pp. 91–93, nos. 106–110, esp. pp. 109–110, no. 108, wherein is further bibliography.

## Condition

In fair condition. Surface bears a slight iridescent sheen on the body and some flaking on the neck.

## Description

The vessel was initially blown in a small, slightly conical mold with 19 vertical ribs. Fire-polished, vertical rim; wide, conical mouth; short neck—actually a constriction at the transition from the mouth to the body. The upper part of the body is cylindrical and the lower is bulbous; both covered with mold-blown ribs, well-defined and vertical on the upper part, faint and S-shaped on the lower part. The vessel stands on a flat, slightly concave bottom. No pontil mark is visible on the bottom.

A thick coil is wound once around the mouth at mid-height. A fine thread is spirally wound ten times around the lower part of the mouth.

## Comparanda

Free- and mold-blown vessels of this particular shape, decorated with thick and thin trails of glass around the mouth, are known from eastern Mediterranean sites: {Dussart 1998}, p. 150, form BX 42, plate 42, from Kerak, dated between the fifth and seventh century CE; a find from Ptolemais from a post-fourth-century fill, see {Kraeling 1962}, p. 270, plate 64b, bottom, center. Unprovenanced examples include one in the Newark Art Museum ({Auth 1976}, p. 217, no. 440); unpublished flask from Toledo Museum of Art, no. 1923.1322. In addition, for a free-blown but very similar example from Israel, dated between the fifth and seventh centuries CE, see {Barag 1974}, p. 13\*, fig. 2:7, plate XXVII:5; for an unprovenanced, smooth example see {Auth 1976}, p. 129, no. 161; {Stern 2001}, p. 305, no. 168; {Israeli 2003a}, p. 172, no. 190; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 162, no. 230.

## Comparanda

Double-handled, lentoid flasks with oblique, mold-blown ribbing on the body are known from the Syro-Palestinian region in the fourth–fifth centuries CE ({Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 37, type IX:8). On most of them the handles are made of a strikingly different glass color ({Hayes 1975}, p. 106, no. 389; {Israeli 2003}, p. 269, no. 359; {Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 396, nos. 1069–1070; {Miho Museum 2001}, p. 106, no. 156; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 96, no. 113), although single-colored examples are known as well ({3000 Jahre Glaskunst}, p. 88, nos. 317–318; {Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 397, nos. 1071–1072).

Covered with iridescence and milky white crust.

## Description

In-folded, flaring, tubular rim; conical mouth constricted at its base, almost forming a diaphragm; skewed oblong, almost cylindrical body, wider toward the bottom, ending in a solid tubular toe with a globular finial. A pair of coil handles have been applied on the shoulders and drawn up to the rim. The mouth is free-blown and smooth; the body is dip mold–blown and decorated with 20 ribs, vertical at the top and on the toe, and S-shaped along the body. Mark of a solid pontil (W. 1 cm) is visible on the bottom.

## Comparanda

No direct comparanda were found, but this flask can be connected to the free-blown tubular jars produced in the Syro-Palestinian region between the fourth and fifth centuries ({Stern 2001}, pp. 255–257, nos. 141–143) and the double kohl tubes from Palestine of the late fourth to the sixth centuries ({Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 39, type 12; {Stern 2001}, pp. 317–320, nos. 179–182); both groups were decorated with spirally wound fine trails, in a fashion quite similar to the effect of the oblique mold-blown ribbing on 2003.342. Furthermore, the vessel can also be associated with the conical flasks with similar handles from Palestine ({Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 37, type 10:4-1, 511).

## Comparanda

This form of plate is widely distributed, mainly in the western Roman provinces, and is dated in the fourth and fifth centuries CE. The incised decoration, which is found on them quite often, indicates that they must had been made in various sites, both in Italy and in the eastern Mediterranean ({Isings 1957}, pp. 36–37, form 18 or rather form 116, pp. 143–144; {Fünfschilling 2015}, pp. 322–323, form AR 55.1; {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 66–67, form 16, wherein many parallels are cited).

## Condition

Intact. Iridescence and some areas with incrustation. An elongated notch, probably a broken air bubble, on the interior near the rim at the area of maximum diameter, where letter Γ is.

## Description

Oval plate with fire-polished rim; shallow, conical body; applied, band-shaped, conical base-ring.

Incised decoration on the exterior: the word ΥΓΕΙΑ (“health”) in capital Greek letters. The letters are formed with double, parallel lines. The letters are arranged loosely around the plate, and each one of them is surrounded by four parallel slanting strokes. In the area in front of the Υ a wheat stalk with an ear of five rows of kernels. On the interior of the bottom a motif that can be understood as another wheat stalk.

## Comparanda

This plate belongs to a quite diverse group of vessels, which include several different shapes—beakers, shallow bowls or dishes, globular flasks or bottles, and one jug—which were decorated with incised decoration and inscriptions with double-line lettering. Finds are dated between the third and fifth centuries CE, mostly to the fourth century CE. It was widely distributed, and it has been proposed that they were produced in a number of dispersed workshops, predominantly in the eastern Mediterranean, western Asia Minor, and Egypt, but also probably Cologne as well ({Fremersdorf 1967}, pp. 105–108, plates 104–109; {Harden 1967/1968}, pp. 43–55; {Grose 1985}, pp. 23–28; {Stern 2001}, pp. 137–138, 160–161; {Lightfoot 2013b}, pp. 358–362).

## Condition

Mended; small body parts are missing.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; partly lopsided, conical mouth; bell-shaped body; pushed-in, tubular ring-base; flat bottom.

A thick white thread is applied flush on the rim. The body is covered with widely spaced light blue, white, and a few yellow specs, giving the impression of a mosaic vessel. A massive, ridged strap handle made of clear/undecorated dark blue glass is attached on the body, bent to form a wide ring, and attached on the mouth area.

## Comparanda

Modioli, a type of relatively wide and deep, one-handled cups, are a quite widespread form of vessel in the late first–early second centuries CE ({Isings 1957}, pp. 52–53, form 37; {Haevernick \[1978\] 1981}, pp. 367–374). Literary sources and pictorial testimony indicate that modioli were used as drinking cups, although the name is a diminutive of modius, a measuring vessel ({Hilgers 1969}, pp. 67–68, 224–225). Most examples have straight walls and bodies that are cylindrical or conical tapering toward the ring-base, like [78.AF.31](#num). A folded tubular flange in the form of a figure eight at the transition from the vertical body to the rim is often present, but not among the JPGM examples. A single wide, circular strap handle is attached to the upper part of the body. The form is considered a western, probably Italian, product, but it is not uncommon in eastern parts of the empire as well. Several variant shapes have been identified, like the bell-shaped 2003.290, which suggest that modioli were produced in a number of workshops. For direct comparanda of 2003.290 see {Kunina 1997}, pp. 149, 291, no. 185; {Whitehouse 1998a}, pp. 42–43, no. 101; {Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 295, no. 875; {Lazar 2003}, p. 58, fig. 19.

## Condition

Reassembled from many fragments; small areas are filled.

## Description

Fire-polished, irregular flaring rim; bulbous body; concave bottom. A small part of a pontil scar is visible on the bottom. Coil handle applied on the upper body, drawn upward, bent to form a wide circle, and attached under the rim. Fine, elongated white stripes traverse the blue ground of the handle.

## Comments and Comparanda

Made with floret segments of mosaic canes, fused together and then free-blown. Each floret is made of a thick blue ground of glass combined with a fine white layer, folded spirally, probably in two revolutions. The flask [2003.241](#num) is made with the same technique. The technique was used mainly for small vessels, such as jars, jugs, handled cups, and cylindrical cups. The distribution of findspots indicates that they were circulating from Britain through northwestern Europe to the northern coast of the Black Sea. Quite probably they were produced from the late first century to the second half of the second century CE, and they occasionally appear in third-century contexts. The mosaic pattern, even when appearing as curved lines, was probably made of florets with circles around a central dot. (On the technique see {Stern 2017}, pp. 132–139; {Stern and Fünfschilling 2020}, pp. 41–68.)

The bulbous shape of the jug connects it to a well-known form of vessels, mainly from Italian sites, dated to the second half of the first century, although lacking the typical thumb-rest tab on the upper part of the handle ({Isings 1957}, p. 76, form 57; {Beretta and Pasquale 2004}, p. 241, nos. 2.39–2.40, p. 251, no. 2.69). The closest parallel, also made of dark blue and white florets, but a bit squat, is known from Nymphaion on the Black Sea coast ({Kunina 1997}, p. 317, no. 315, ill. 167). With regard to the shape, equally close are three examples from Nymphaion ({Kunina 1997}, p. 317, nos. 312–314, ill. 166), another one, pale blue, is known from Cornus, Sardenia ({Fortuna Canivet 1969}, p. 24, fig. 23). Also, cf. {von Saldern et al. 1974}, no. 641.

## Condition

Condition is good, and vessel is intact. Some small areas of iridescence and some minor nicks and scratches.

## Description

Rough, uneven, cracked-off, slightly flaring rim; hemispherical body; slightly concave bottom. Around the body, 1.7 cm below rim, are 16 unevenly spaced, vertical pinched ribs. A white thread is wound around the vessel from the center of the bottom to just below rim: nine rotations in the area below rim, ten rotations on the ribs (almost invisible between the ribs), and at least two more on the lowest part of the body to the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

One of the earliest free-blown forms of tableware are the ribbed bowls, known by the German term “zarten Rippenschalen.” They appear at the beginning of the first century CE and cease to be produced shortly after the middle of the century. They were made in natural bluish and greenish glass ([2003.227](#num)), but also in intense colors, including translucent brown, blue (2003.226), and purple ([2004.20](#num)). Milky white threads were often used to decorate the intensely colored vases, and opaque white examples were decorated with translucent blue threads. These threads were spirally wound from the center of the bottom to the transition to the rim of the vessel, and then the ribs were pinched around the body. A considerable number of published examples are monochrome and do not have any additional applied decoration. On the form and many direct parallels from controlled excavation sites see {Haevernick \[1958\] 1981}, pp. XI–XXVIII; {Haevernick \[1967\] 1981; {Isings 1957}, pp. 35–36, form 17; {Lith 1977}, pp. 29–38; {Biaggio-Simona 1991}, pp. 71–74; {Rütti 1991}; {Fünfschilling 2015}, AR 28; {Stern 2001}, pp. 82–83, no. 24; {Weinberg and Stern 2009}, pp. 45–46; {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 57–58, form 8.

## Condition

Mended; part of the rim is filled.

## Description

Cracked-off, slightly inward-leaning rim; wide body, curving in toward the flat bottom. A faint horizontal incision is visible 0.4 cm below the rim.

Around the body painted decoration is arranged, comprising four main features:

A reddish-brown gazelle, with short strokes along its belly and long, nearly straight antlers, is presented in profile, moving to the right. The gazelle is mid-stride, with its hind legs shown at some distance from one another, while its front are shown parallel and very close to one another, as if standing. The animal has a large eye, open mouth, and ears bent back. The body of the animal partly conceals a bush with big lanceolate leaves.

In front of the gazelle is a large bow of three garlands tied together—ribbons—whose central part is decorated with flowers. The lateral garlands are held up by both ends while one end of the central garland hangs down in a loose spiral. The two lateral garlands have yellow flowers, and the central one has red flowers.

To the right of the garlands, a bird is depicted in profile, standing on short grass and in front of a bush. Its body is outlined in red, black, and yellow, and its feet are red. The bird has a round head and short beak; it is possibly a partridge.

Further to the right are depicted two more birds of the same species, apparently dead, hanging by their feet.

The decoration concludes a large bow of three ribbons, whose central part is decorated with flowers. Two are yellow, and the one at the center is red. The perimeter of the vessel’s bottom is delineated with 36 strokes. Four ends of what was once an eight-pointed star are visible on the bottom of the vessel.

## Comments and Comparanda

This form of first-century bowl is quite widely distributed ({Isings 1957}, pp. 27–30, form 12). There are 80 known vessels with enameled decoration like 2003.294; aside from these predominantly identical bowls, there are two amphoriskoi ({Rütti 1991b}, pp. 124–130; {Whitehouse 2001a}, pp. 255–258, nos. 846–852; {Rütti 2003}, pp. 341–349; {Mandruzzato and Marcante 2005}, pp. 46, 93, no. 215; {Czurda-Ruth 2007}, pp. 59–60, no. 104, plates 7 and 34; {Nenna 2008}, pp. 15–29). They were mostly made of a dark-color glass acting as a contrasting background for the polychrome decoration. The decoration was pulverized colored glass, bound with oil or water, applied with a brush on to the vessel’s surface, and subsequently fired at a relatively low temperature, enough to fuse it but not so high as to deform the vessel. The decoration of these enameled vessels included vine tendrils, ivy leaves, garlands, and animals (bird, fish, gazelle); a few bear Nilotic scenes. Usually, the underside of the bottoms was decorated with a bird, a rosette, or a star, like this example. They are dated in the period between 20 and 70 CE, and it is still not established whether they were produced in Italy or, less probably, in the eastern Mediterranean. Among the overall similar decorations appearing on this group of vessels, the closest to this bowl are three bowls from Piedmont, Olbia, and Greece ({Rütti 1991b}, plate 35b, fig. 25a–c).

## Description

The rim is cracked-off; truncated conical upper part of body, and convex lower part, with flat bottom; wheel-engraved lines 0.3 cm below the rim and a fine horizontal incision on the lower part of the body (3.7 cm from rim).

## Comments and Comparanda

Among the earliest examples of free-blown vessels are those known as “Hofheim cups.” They are thick, usually bluish but occasionally intensely-colored vessels, with wheel-cut horizontal grooves on the exterior, bulbous bodies, and high kicks at the bottom, characteristics that date them to the second half of the first century CE. They are ascribed to Italian or northwestern European workshops. The form generally appears in late Augustan and mainly Tiberian–Claudian contexts. Earlier examples are straight-walled with flat bottom; later ones are more bulbous and they have sharp, high kicks on the bottom. Both features lead to an earlier date for the 2003.362 ({Isings 1957}, pp. 27–30, form 12; {Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 31, type III:1; {Czurda-Ruth 1979}, pp. 37–43; {Oliver 1983}, p. 255, no. 51, fig. 4; {Stern 2001}, pp. 73–74, nos. 16, 17; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 108, nos. 134–135).

Intact; some areas covered with iridescent weathering; very few pinprick bubbles.

## Description

In-folded and flattened, flaring rim; conical body; pushed-in base-ring; concave bottom. Pair of crimped coil (pseudo-)handles on opposite sides of the rim. At the center of the bottom is a faint annular pontil mark.

## Comparanda

This form has a flaring fire-polished rim, hemispherical body, and pushed-in tubular ring-base. Two horizontal, crimped pseudo-handles are placed at opposite sides on the edge of the rim. The finds are widely distributed in both the eastern and western provinces of the Roman Empire. They were produced during the first century CE, and they occasionally appear in the early second century as well; considered to be an Italian product ({Isings 1957}, p. 59, form 43; {Stern 1977}, pp. 57–58; {Antonaras 2017}, p. 59, form 11).

## Condition

Intact; parts covered with milky crust and iridescence; very few pinprick bubbles.

## Description

Out-folded, tubular rim; convex body walls form a hemispherical body that tapers toward the flat bottom. The vessel rests on an applied pad base. In the interior of the vessel a relief ring (W. 1.5, Th. 0.5 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom. This was probably formed when the pontil, which was attached on the bottom for the shaping of the rim, was removed, before the pad base was applied. At the center of the base a circular pontil scar (W. 1.1 cm) is visible.

## Comments and Comparanda

This form of bowl with a distinctive inward-leaning, flattened tubular rim is defined by the out-folded tubular rim, which can be either vertical, everted, or inward-leaning, and the hemispherical body on a pushed-in base. The form appears around the middle of the first century CE, and becomes very popular in Flavian times ({Isings 1957}, pp. 59–60, form 44a). There are dozens of comparanda from Italy and the Adriatic region, all of them dated to the first century CE and ascribed to a North Italian workshop ({Calvi 1968}, pp. 67–68, group C, plate C:7; {Roffia 1993}, p. 78, no. 47; {Mandruzzato and Mercante 2005}, pp. 28, 96–97, nos. 232–235, 237; {Bonomi 1996}, p. 163, nos. 368, 369; {Pesavento-Mattioli and Cipriano 1992}, p. 135, tomb 1, fig. 4:12–13; {Toniolo 2000}, p. 124; {Casagrande and Ceselin 2003}, p. 177, nos. 266, 267; {Larese 2004}, pp. 49–50; {Alfano 1997}, p. 175, no. 156; {Facchini 1999}, pp. 252–253, nos. 606–609; {Roffia 1993}, p. 78, no. 47; {Biaggio Simona 1991}, pp. 83–85, form 5.3.4., figs. 41, 42).

## Comments and Comparanda

Among the finds from Egyptian sites there are several deep bowls with conical and convex-shaped body, standing on a base-ring. There is a group with a distinctive, considerably wide, horizontal rim that had either fire-polished lip or one that was folded at the end, forming a vertical lip suited for the securing of a lid; dated to the fifth–sixth centuries ({Harden 1936}, pp. 95–98, form deep bowls A.I.b.I, A.III.a; {Whitehouse 1997a}, pp. 81–82, nos. 107–110; {Hayes 1975}, pp. 2–3 for their re-dating, on the basis of pottery co-finds, from the third–fourth to the fifth–sixth centuries).

## Description

Fire-polished, horizontal, rim, pinched to form 13 shallow scallops; a horizontal flange on the underside of the rim, at the transition to the body. The body is cylindrical, gently tapering toward the slightly convex bottom. Tooled, conical base with slanting tooling marks. At the center of the bottom is a solid, circular pontil mark (W. 0.9 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

Vessels of this form have a horizontal rim with fire-polished, scalloped edge; vertical body walls; flat bottom; and low, pushed-in, slightly conical ring-base ({Isings 1957}, p. 58, form 42d). The edge of the rim and the transition from the body to the rim are occasionally emphasized by winding a fine thread of strongly-colored glass wound around them. The form is dated mainly to the fourth century CE. The fact, however, that vessels of the same shape appear in pottery in the fifth and sixth centuries ({Hayes 1972}, pp. 50–51, 82–83; {Robinson 1959}, p. 116, no. 349, plate 71), and also in silverware in the sixth century ({Boyd 1992}, p. 29, S44.1, S44.2), makes it quite likely that glass vessels continued to be produced at least during the fifth century, as is also indicated by glass finds from several western Mediterranean sites ({Antonaras 2017}, p. 67, form 18). Published parallels include the following: {Harden 1936}, p. 97 and 111, plate XIV; {von Saldern 1974}, p. 125, no. 164; {Fremersdorf 1975}, p. 63, no. 576, plate 25; {Auth 1975}, p. 160, nos. 66, 67, plate 32; {Platz-Horster 1976}, p. 88, no. 176; {La Baume and Salomonson 1976}, p. 57, no. 183, plate 25, 4; {von Saldern 1980b}, p. 108, no. 107; {Tatton-Brown 1984}, p. 195, no. 10; {Duncan-Jones 1994}, p. 11; {Pastorino 2000}, p. 111, no. 16; {Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 141, no. 650.

## Description

Slightly flaring, cracked-off rim; deep hemispherical body that rests on a flattened bottom. Wide, horizontal wheel-cut grooves decorate the body: one under the rim, a pair at mid-height, and one more at one-third height.

## Comments and Comparanda

Hemispherical bowls with unworked rim, slightly everted; hemispherical or even deeper body, flat base; and flat, occasionally slightly concave bottom are a very widely distributed form of glass vessel. They appear from the second century CE, and they were most widely distributed during the late third and fourth century, surviving into the fifth century ({Isings 1957}, pp. 113–114, 131–133, form 96; {Goethert-Polaschek 1977}, pp. 50–59, form 49a; {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 60–63, form 12). The majority are undecorated, but there are many examples bearing engraved/wheel-cut decoration ([2003.349](#num), [2004.38](#num), and [2004.37](#num)) with geometrical and figural representations, and there are examples with applied decoration, consisting occasionally of blue threads and mostly of blue blobs ([2003.454](#num), [2003.455](#num)).

Hemispherical bowls with incised decoration can be grouped into those with shallow horizontal bands, which are the simplest and most numerous group, and those with bands of ovular or rice grain–shaped strokes, which present a well-defined group both aesthetically and chronologically. Their decoration presents a simplified variant of the first-century vessels with multifaceted engraving, and they are dated to the third–fourth centuries.

Single deeper and wider grooves are found on vessels of the late first or early second century CE, which are ascribed to Italian workshops ({Isings 1957}, pp. 37–38, form 21; {Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 224, no. 378). Hemispherical bowls, some of them decorated with incised grooves, are dated to the third and fourth centuries CE ({Isings 1957}, pp. 114–116, form 96b; {Antonaras 2017}, p. 61, form 12.ii.a). Published examples of bowls decorated with simple incised bands are numerous ({Cool and Price 1995}, pp. 88–90, plate 5:16; {Arveiller-Dulong and Arveiller 1985}, p. 105, nos. 201–204; {Goethert-Polaschek 1977}, pp. 59–61, form 49b, nos. 222–232, figs. 20, 21, plates 38, 39; {Follmann-Schulz 1988}, pp. 103–105, nos. 376–378, 385, plates 43, 44; {Fünfschilling 2015}, pp. 119–121, 310, fig. 157, form AR 40; {Weinberg and Stern 2009}, pp. 50, 75, no. 98, fig. 6, plate 9, and pp. 92–96). Bowls of the third century CE with wheel-cut geometric decoration are also well-known ({Isings 1957}, pp. 113–116, form 96; {Antonaras 2009}, pp. 117–124, form 12.2.a = {Antonaras 2017}, p. 61; {Sennequier 1985}, pp. 54–55, no. 26; {Arveiller-Dulong and Arveiller 1985}, pp. 106–107, nos. 205, 206; {Fremersdorf 1967}, pp. 68–70, 73, 90–93, plates 32–35, 40, 72, 74–78, 80; {Sorokina 1967}, pp. 72–73, 76, figs. 3:24–26, 5:12; {Lightfoot 1993}, pp. 90–95, plate 1; {von Saldern 1980a}, pp. 15–18, no. 64, plate 3; {Harden 1936}, p. 120, no. 317, plate 14). Zoned facet cutting was a widespread motif, and the decoration continued that of earlier, first- and second-century examples, which bore more densely and regularly arranged interlocking facets ({Isings 1957}, pp. 113–116, form 96; {Davidson 1952}, p. 95, no. 592, fig. 6). For third–fourth century parallels see: {Clairmont 1963}, pp. 55–74, esp. 65–68; {Sorokina 1978}; {Barkóczi 1986}; {Cool and Price 1995}, pp. 76–78; {Foy and Nenna 2003b}, pp. 277–278; {Antonaras 2009}, pp. 117–124, form 12.2.a = {Antonaras 2017}, p. 61; {Barkóczi 1988}, pp. 77–78, nos. 39, 42; {Paolucci 1997}, pp. 119–120.

Several workshops have been identified on the basis of the distribution patterns and the shape of the cuts (circular, oval, and rice grain) and their combinations. Namely, they have been ascribed to four production centers, at Cologne; in Pannonia; in Syria, possibly at Dura-Europos; and at Tanais on the Black Sea coast ({Weinberg and Stern 2009}, pp. 94–96, with further bibliography). Colorless glass was almost always used for faceting, because it made this type of decoration more pronounced ([2003.349](#num), [96.AF.320](#num), possibly [2004.39](#num) as well). The facets were usually left unpolished and a bit rough, and this difference between the smooth surface of the vessel and the darker areas of the facets created a striking appearance. This is visible, for example, on bowls [2003.349](#num) and [2004.38](#num).
