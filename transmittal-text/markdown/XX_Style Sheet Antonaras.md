ALL GLOSSARY ITEMS

> There is a glossary at the back, and those should be links in the final version. Glossary terms will be pop-up links, so if you hover over the term, you’ll see the definition. When a glossary term comes up, to code it as a link, surround it by double brackets. 
>
>  
>
> For example, “the flask is a \[\[cast vessel\]\].”
>
>  
>
> It might also come up that the glossary term appears in the text in an alternate form. If that happens, you’ll put it in double brackets, with the glossary term first, then a pipe, then the display text (no spaces around the pipe). 
>
>  
>
> So for example, “these flasks are all \[\[cast vessel\|cast vessels\]\].”
>
>  
>
> Finally, some of the object descriptions repeat glossary information, and I think that would better be cut and then linked as above.

Coding Notes:

--Paragraphs in same fields begin with tabs.

--Each entry will eventually be in its own file. For editing I’ve separated entries by page breaks.\\. Name according to convention noted in Quire sample.

--Sending along two concordances (label:accession number; accession number:label)
