## Condition

Single fragment broken all around.

## Description

White and turquoise stripes of various widths curving on a dark, translucent purple background. The back of the inlay was scored, while still hot, with parallel and crosshatched grooves that form a loose network of lozenges, probably for better adhesion of the tile to the object in which it was set.

## Condition

Vessel fragment in fair condition. Surface is slightly pitted.

## Description

Body fragment, slightly convex in horizontal cross section, of a cameo glass vessel. The outside is decorated in cameo technique. The decoration is opaque white and the background is opaque green. The fragment shows the upper body of a frontal young male figure, facing to the left, beardless, with short hair, whose chest is bare and who wears a cloak (chlamys) attached around his neck and thrown back over his shoulders. The folds of the edge of the chlamys wrap over his extended left arm. He wears wide, loose trousers, the [braccae]{.underline} or ἀναξυρίδες worn by barbarians, forming a fold around his waist and covering the drawstring that kept it in place ([[Mau 1893]]). The figure is a barbarian ostler. His right arm is extended upward to grasp the bridle of a rearing horse. All that is preserved of the horse is the end of the muzzle, the chest, and the two front legs. Next to the extended left arm at the end of the preserved fragment is a raising of the ground, quite probably the beginning of another figure or motif.

The back side is mildly uneven and generally smooth, except for three curved, slanting ridges. Practically no pitting observable.

## Comments and Comparanda

On cameo glass vessels see comments on [84.AF.85](#cat). This fragment differs from the majority of glass cameos in its green lower layer, and no actual parallels were located.

## Condition

Single fragment preserving the upper left corner of an originally rectangular plaque.

## Description

On the fragment is relief decoration in the form of a two-tiered tendril with voluminous, modular stems, which end in a tripartite tip. Four-petaled flowers hanging from minuscule stems fill the areas between the branches of the tendril. The plaque is opaque light blue glass throughout its thickness. The rear of the plaque is flat but rough, dull, and pitted. It preserves two of the original edges at the upper and left sides, which are vertical and smooth.

## Comments

In Roman times, in about the first century CE, molded glass inlay plaques, mainly rectangular or rounded in shape, appear in relatively large numbers. In general, Roman molded decorative plaques appear to be either single-colored, sometimes made throughout of one single color or have internally a core of a different color (white or translucent bluish), or they are cameos presenting the relief decoration usually in two—but less often in more—layers of different colors. They are formed by pressing glass in an open mold, or in the case of multilayered polychromic objects, by the pressing and fusion of layers of powdered glass, one for each layer of different color ([[Lierke 1999]], pp. 78–80). Medusa heads ([[Harden et al. 1987]], p. 30, no. 8; [[Spaer 2001]], p. 254, nos. 613–614; [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011]], pp. 399–401, nos. 655–662) are common motifs, and human portraits, masks, and other figurative motifs appear too ([[Alfano 1997]], p. 210, no. 221; [[Whitehouse 1997a]], pp. 20–22, 26–27, nos. 7–12, 20–22; [[Spaer 2001]], p. 254, no. 612; [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011]], pp. 401–403, nos. 663–672; [[Gerspach 1885]], p. 43, fig. 16 = <https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O2354/panel-unknown/>; <https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O127/panel/>), as are floral motifs, like oak leaves and acorns ([[Whitehouse 1997a]], pp. 22–23, nos. 13–14, 16; [[Miho Museum 2001]], p. 71, no. 83–84 \[A. Yoko\]; [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011]], p. 403, nos. 673–676).

## Comparanda

Identical to 2003.355 seem to be two pieces from old Italian collections ([[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011]], p. 403, no. 674; [[Whitehouse 1997]], p. 22, no. 13); the second is fully preserved, providing information about the exact positioning of the fragment and the dimensions of the original plaque (H. 7.7, W. 4.5 cm). In addition, regarding the rest of the motif it becomes evident that it was even more diverse and the two lower rows of the foliage bore bell-shaped flowers, which of course might be the same as the four-petaled flowers on the top row, only presented in profile. In addition, in the Oppenländer collection there was another fragment of a very similar plaque ([[von Saldern et al. 1974]], p. 192, no. 525a).

## Description

A stamped, roughly discoid appliqué with a theater mask. Comical mask with small, circular eye-openings, wide-open smiling mouth, a prominent wig comprised of 26 radiantly arranged ribs, and a protuberance on the center of the forehead. Visible on the back side are traces of the strap handle and the body of the jug this once decorated.

## Comparanda

Discoid medallions decorated with molded relief motifs were used to embellish sumptuous tableware, predominantly jugs and bowls, from the first century CE and again in the third–fourth centuries CE ([[Antonaras 2017]], pp. 167–169, form 149). The medallion was usually placed on the base of the jug handle. Alternatively, it may have been added either singly or as one of a group of stamped bosses on the body of the vessel ([[von Saldern 1968]], no. 55; [[Isings 1964]], pp. 59–63; [[Harden et al. 1968]], p. 85, no. 112; [[Harden et al. 1987]], pp. 204–205, no. 113). In addition to theatrical masks, which have been associated with the role of the “hegemon therapon,” that is, the older, principal slave from Greek comedy ([[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], p. 429), the repertoire included heads of Medusa, Silenus, satyrs, and several objects connected to the cult of Dionysus (such as the thyrsus and Pan pipes), as well as lion heads. For more parallels with theatrical masks see [[Edgar 1905]], plate 10, nos. 32.762–767; [[Auth 1976]], p. 107, no. 123; [[Clairmont 1977]], plate 12, no. 39; [[Welker 1987]], p. 17, no. 10 (left, inv. no. 87.61); [[Sangiorgi 1999]], p. 66 nos. 153–154 and 157; [[Whitehouse 2001b]], pp. 232–233, nos. 811–812; [[Israeli 2003]], p. 190, no. 224; [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], pp. 440–441, nos. 1227–1234; [[Lightfoot 2007]], p. 180, no. 464; [[Antonaras 2012]], p. 282, no. 464.

Fragment.

## Description

Appliqué in the shape of a fish. The mouth forms the opening, and there is a large dorsal fin with vertical striations separately applied. The end of the tail has broken off. On the back side of the fish’s body is visible the scar from the point that connected the appliqué to the vessel.

## Comments and Comparanda

This appliqué belongs to a type of cup, known as conchylia cups, that was decorated with three or four rows of fish, shells, and other sea creatures. These faced left, like this example, or more rarely vertically (on the class see [[Doppelfeld 1973]]; [[Doppelfeld 1976]]). Three of the known examples were found in Cologne ([[Fremersdorf 1961]], pp. 23–24, plate 15 and pp. 26–27, plate 21; [[Doppelfeld 1973]], pp. 281–283, figs. 1–3; [[[Glass from the Ancient World]{.underline} 1957]], p. 255, no. 144), one from Trier ([[Goethert-Polaschek 1977]], pp. 63–64, no. 241, and p. 319, tomb 252, plate 24), and one from Rome ([[Fremersdorf 1975]], pp. 72–73, no. 706, plate 32). Single fish have been found around the Mediterranean, such as at Corinth ([[Davidson 1952]], p. 98, no. 619, plate 54; [[Antonaras 2022]], pp. 52, 98, no. 201) and on Crete ([[Price 1992]], pp. 428, 447, no. 160); others were purchased in eastern Mediterranean cities, such as Cairo ([[[Glass from the Ancient World]{.underline} 1957]], p. 163, no. 336; [[Whitehouse 2001a]], p. 237, no. 824) and Tyre ([[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005]], no. 981), and yet another, unprovenanced one has been published ([[Schlick-Nolte 2002]], p. 102, no. V-64). They are considered to be products of the region of Cologne or Trier, and of another production center on the Mediterranean. The few of them that can be dated independently are placed at the end of the third–early fourth century CE.

The fact that several single fish appliqués have been unearthed as isolated finds in excavation indicates that once they were separated from the body of the vessel they were kept and repurposed, probably as amulets ([[Stern 2001]], p. 141).

## Comments and Comparanda

In Mycenaean Greece the use of glass reaches its peak between 1400 and 1200 BCE. Glass products were mostly beads—simple and relief ones—almost always of dark blue glass cast in open molds ([[Haevernick \[1960\] 1981; Haevernick \[1963\] 1981; Haevernick \[1979\] 1981]], pp. 71–83, 109–112, 190–193, 440–447; [[Nightingale 2000]], pp. 6–10; [[Nightingale 2018]], pp. 30–60). Relief beads appear either as a plaque with the motif pressed on it, or else entirely in the shape of the depicted motif. The decoration on relief beads consists of floral, faunal, anthropomorphic, and mythological themes, objects, and other abstract motifs. The motifs most widely present are the rosette ([2003.214.3](#num), [2003.214.4](#num)), the lily, the ivy leaf (2004.15.1, [2004.15.2](#num), [2003.214.8](#num), [2003.214.9](#num), [2003.214.10](#num), [2003.214.17](#num)), and the papyrus flower. Common animal motifs are the single and double argonaut ([2003.214.5](#num), [2003.214.6](#num), [2003.214.7](#num), [2004.15.5](#num), [2004.15.6](#num)), the triton shell, and, rarely, the octopus. The most common object motifs are the curl, the volute ([2004.15.3](#num), [2004.15.4](#num), [2004.15.5](#num)), the wave or bracket ([2003.214.1](#num), [2003.214.2](#num), [2004.15.7](#num)), the circular ornament, the figure-of-eight shield ([2003.214.11](#num), [2003.214.12](#num), [2003.214.13](#num), [2003.214.14](#num), [2003.214.15](#num), [2003.214.16](#num)), a libation jug, and the bi-concave altar. Motifs of human and/or mythical figures include the sphinx, the Minoan/Mycenaean Genius, and the woman in formal Minoan/Mycenaean dress ([[Nightingale 2018]], p. 36).

Molds have been unearthed in and around palaces, indicating centralized production of these items. In addition to beads (but only seldomly), other objects, such as seals, sword hilts, gaming pieces, and pins, were made of glass. Although many of the beads have two holes and thus would have served as spacer-beads holding together several strings of beads, in the Mycenaean period they were strung together to form necklaces, sewn on garments, or even used as diadems.

## Description

Flattened, irregular cylindrical gold-glass bead. Thread hole along its longer dimension.

An impressed standing nude young male figure is depicted on the front of the bead. He is the god Harpocrates, the son of Isis and Osiris ([LIMC]{.underline} IV.1 s.v. “Harpocrates,” pp. 415–445, esp. pp. 419–423 for representations with cornucopia). He rests his weight on his right leg, and his left leg is slightly bent so that the pelvis and torso are positioned in contrapposto. The figure has protruding belly. The head is presented en face. The figure bends his right hand up across his chest in the typical gesture of silence, with the index finger to his lips. With his left hand he holds a large cornucopia next to his body.

The back side of the bead is undecorated and smooth.

## Comments and Comparanda

Gold-glass beads appear from the Hellenistic period onward. They are made of two layers of glass with metal foil between them as their principal decoration. They were used as a substitute for metal beads and they were popular in Egypt, where they were probably produced, and in Nubia. Rhodes, Macedonia, and the Black Sea coast have also been identified as manufacturing centers of gold-glass beads ([[Alekseeva 1978]], pp. 27–32; [[Weinberg 1971]], pp. 147–148, figs. 1–2, plate 82a; [[Spaer 1993]], pp. 9–25; [[Spaer 2001]], pp. 130–135). Usually they are plain, occasionally are decorated with ribbing or granular patterns and very rarely with impressed motifs like the god Harpocrates and a female deity ([[Spaer 2001]], p. 137, nos. 234–235; [[Spaer 1993]], p. 16, fig. 11). An almost identical bead is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (acc. no.: 10.130.2477; <https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/558843>) and in the British Museum (reg. no. 1879,0522.33; [https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1879–0522-33](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1879-0522-33)). Harpocrates was also represented on glass pendants, dating to the late second–first century BCE ([[Froehner 1903]], no. 843, p. 122, plate 151.3, 151.5, now part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art collection; also one in the Louvre: [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011]], p. 39, no. 28).

## Description

Perforated section of a cylindrical mosaic cane, forming a flat, disc-shaped bead. The string hole cuts the cane horizontally behind the face.

A female face is represented, with almond-shaped eyes, curved eyebrows, straight nose, and oval, slightly parted red lips. A thin band, around the face to behind the ears, renders the hair. Eleven strands form a sparse fringe on the forehead, possibly representing snake heads, a feature that would identify the depicted female as Medusa. The facial features and the hair are rendered in dark-colored glass, seemingly black. A cobalt blue band under the chin. The face is set in a red and a green layer of glass.

## Comments and Comparanda

Mosaic face beads appear in the first century CE, either as globular beads with a row of faces at the greatest diameter or as flat, round, or square beads. Flat face beads, square in cross section, require only one floret, as opposed to the spherical ones, which can accommodate between two and eight, with most having four faces in a single row of faces spanning the mid-section of the bead, usually arranged in alternating pattern with florets with geometrical motifs (Selling type I; for an overview see [[Stout 1985]], pp. 22–29, map 1, appendix I; [[Stout 1986]], pp. 58–59; [[Liu 2008]]). The face beads were not necessarily produced in the same workshops where the mosaic canes were produced. The canes, intact or cut into florets, may have been sold to other workshops, operating either nearby or farther afield.

Mosaic glass quite often is ascribed to Alexandrian or other Egyptian workshops, but no glass workshops for this kind of product have been found, so this hypothesis remains unproven. The beads are known in archaeologically dated contexts from Meroë-Nubia to Rome, Herculaneum, the Black Sea coast, and the Baltic region. Most of the beads have a schematic rendering of the face, in which the Gorgon has been identified due to the dentil-like projections that frame the upper part of the face, schematically depicting snakes. A few other beads have a more naturalistic presentation of the face, with longer hair and a necklace around the neck, like those found in Meroë, the Black Sea coast, and Poland, and the one kept in the Corning Museum of Glass ([[Dunham 1957]], numbers 21-3-57b, 21-12-129b2, and 21-12-130d, figs. 80, 89, plate LXVII; [[Kazimierczak 1980]]; [[Alekseeva 1982]], pp. 36, 40, color plate 48, no. 33; [[Goldstein 1979]], pp. 274–275, no. 822). In the Corning Museum of Glass there is also a double-convex glass mosaic patella made of rhomboid florets, among which are interspersed four florets of this type of face cane ([[Goldstein 1979]], pp. 186–187, no. 497). Two fragments of mosaic glass once in the Gréau collection also contained face canes ([[Froehner 1903]], p. 119, plate 133.17, 19, no. 828).

In the fourth century CE there is a reappearance of face and checker mosaic beads (see comments on [2004.12](#cat)), but significantly larger and with some differences in the rendering of the motifs. They are quite rare and are found exclusively north of the Alps. These later (fourth- and fifth-century) checker beads have three registers of designs, occasionally completed with florets of star-shaped motifs. New types of faces appear, with helmet and different hairstyle. It has been proposed that they are Constantinian and that they were presented either to northerners serving in the imperial guard or to chieftains, in return for their military assistance (Selling type II; [[Stout 1985]], pp. 30–46; [[Stout 1986]], p. 60).

## Description

Flat, rectangular bead consisting of a section/floret of a mosaic cane, square in cross section. The floret depicts a female face set at the center of the bead on both sides. Angular eyebrow, almond-shaped eye staring straight ahead; small, wide mouth with red lips. A thin band around the face to behind the ears renders the hair. Several strands form a sparse fringe on the forehead, possibly representing snake heads, a feature that would identify the depicted female as Medusa. The facial features and the hair are rendered in dark-colored glass, seemingly black but actually translucent purple. A thick band under the chin. The face is set in a yellow and translucent purple layer of glass. The thread hole crosses the bead horizontally, which sets the face correctly when the bead is strung on a necklace.

## Description

A spherical bead made of composite mosaic canes, with florets arranged in two rows and ca. five columns. These slices were fused together as a flat mass and were subsequently folded around a rod and rolled. The seam of this folding is still visible along the edge of the hole in the bead. Each floret consists of 9 × 9 micro-tesserae in which a central yellow square tessera is surrounded by red, white, “black,” and white angular lozenges, which form a checkerboard pattern.

## Comments and Comparanda

Mosaic glass beads with checker pattern placed at the greatest diameter of the bead, in rhomboid position, appear in early Roman (mainly first-century CE) graves, for example in Meroë ([[Dunham 1957]], p. 122, fig. 80, no. 21-3-57a; pp. 130–131, fig. 86, no. 23-2-79c; pp. 135–136, fig. 89, no. 21-12-129b-9), Egypt ([[Fitzwilliam 1978]], pp. 28–29, nos. 46a, b, c), Poland, and Germany ([[Tempelmann-Maczynska 1985]], pp. 59–60, type 364, with a band of rhomboids, type 368 in a carpet pattern), and the Black Sea coast ([[Alekseeva 1982]], pp. 36, 40, color plate 49, nos. 67–87 (graves of the first–second centuries)). They also appear in third-century graves in Denmark and Norway ([[Stout 1985]], pp. 32–37). Most are globular and a few are barrel-shaped or flat. Checker pattern most often appear as multicolored diamonds. For mosaic beads with female faces on them see comments on [2003.259](#cat).

## Description

A spherical bead made of seven circular blue and seven or eight rectangular yellow slices of composite mosaic canes arranged in three rows and ca. five columns. These slices were fused together as a flat mass and were subsequently folded around a rod and pressed at the edges, forming a globular bead. The seam of this folding is still visible along the bead. Each circular floret contains an eight-petaled rosette. A central yellow rod is enclosed in a red layer, which is surrounded by eight white triangular petals fused in dark blue glass. Each square floret contains a checkerboard motif set in a layer of red glass. The checkerboard comprises six columns with six rows of square, tiny, alternately greenish and yellow tesserae.

## Description

A cylindrical bead made of 20 circular tesserae arranged in four rows and roughly five columns. These slices were fused together as a flat mass and subsequently folded around a rod and rolled. The seam of this folding is still visible along the edge of the hole in the bead. Each tessera comprises the following: a thick white rod surrounded by finer red and white layers, in turn surrounded by a translucent green layer in which are arranged at equal distances ten minuscule white rods.

## Comparanda

Glass eye beads were used from the eighth century BCE and were widely used during the sixth and fifth centuries BCE: [[Ignatiadou and Chatzinikolaou 2002]], pp. 65–69, wherein further bibliography; [[Adam-Veleni and Ignatiadou 2010]], pp. 189, 190, 191, 197–198, 208–209, 238–239, 318–320, 323–325, nos. 29, 31–31, 33, 45, 61–63, 118–119, 310–317, 319–320, 322, all dated by their archaeological contexts to the sixth and fifth centuries BCE. For small-size examples, see in particular pp. 189, 320, 323, nos. 29 and 317, 320, dated to the fifth century BCE; finds from Olynthos at pp. 371–373, nos. 422–429 are dated in the fourth century by the destruction of the city, yet they may well be of the fifth century BCE as well.

## Description

Dark blue (appearing black), cylindrical, rod-formed pendant in the shape of a bearded male head. The basic dark purple mass includes the elongated beard as well. The eyes are made of white disks, which are probably ring beads, and smaller disks of dark blue glass render the pupils. The ears are made of small, yellowish ring beads. Lips are rendered with a disk of yellowish glass, pressed in the middle to form the mouth. The nose is made of an applied, triangular, black mass. A white dot is at the middle of the upper forehead. No traces of hair and eyebrows are preserved, or ever existed. Suspension loop partly missing. Remains of dark brown sandy coating adhere to interior of tiny rod hole.

## Comments and Comparanda

A group of relatively large glass pendants found throughout the Mediterranean, dated from the sixth to the first centuries BCE, are ascribed to Punic civilization. There is a wide variety of themes rendered in these pendants, including demon’s heads; African heads; male heads with curly hair, with or without beard, which can be sleek, fluted, curly, or Newgate fringe; female heads with long neck or with twisted hairstyle; and animal heads, as of a ram, hen, cock, monkey, or dog; and various other motifs, including a bell, a wine grape, a phallus. They all have a suspension loop at the top and wide hole at the bottom; they were made around a core on a metal rod and the remains of the scraped-out core are still visible in the walls of the hole. The earliest pendants are the demon’s heads that appear in the second part of the seventh century BCE in the eastern Mediterranean and Carthage. The production of pendants in general seems to go out of fashion in the first century BCE. In general, they are found in Egypt, Phoenicia, Cyprus, Rhodes, the Black Sea coast, Carthage—where very large number of them were found and it has been proposed that they were produced—Italy, Spain, and the Balearic Islands. They had a clearly apotropaic character, and they probably were meant to depict some form of demon or minor divinity ([[Seefried 1979]], pp. 17–26; [[Seefried 1982]]).

Male heads present the largest group among Punic head pendants. 2003.206 is a bald variant of a subgroup made of dark (appearing black) glass representing heads of Africans, and in particular to the small group of the ones that do not have a beard ([[Seefried 1982]], pp. 117–118, plate II, type B.I.a), which are dated between 450 and 200 BCE. Other published pendants of this type include: a pendant at the British Museum ([[Tatton-Brown 1981]], pp. 148–149, no. 408), and one sold in an auction ([[Bonhams 2022]], p. 130, no. 209).

## Description

Turquoise, cylindrical, rod-formed pendant rendering a bearded male head. The turquoise base mass includes the hair and the elongated beard. This core was partly covered with yellow glass to represent the skin of the face, as was an elongated, pinched, yellow lump rendering the ear. An earring hanging from the preserved ear lobe is made of white glass. The eye was made of three overlapping disks of dark blue, white, and lighter blue glass of gradually smaller diameters so that they are all visible. Lips consist of a disk of white glass pressed in the middle to form the mouth. Translucent dark blue glass is curled around the forehead, forming relief locks, and a dark blue horizontal band forms the eyebrow.

Remains of dark red sandy coating adhere to interior of tiny rod hole.

## Comments and Comparanda

## Description

Rod-formed pendant rendering a bearded male head. The head was formed with white glass wound around the tip of a rod which was covered with an organic mass; the hole has max. Diam. 0.6 cm and it is clean inside, not retaining any remains of the core. This mass was pressed to form the nose. Then, hair, eyes, ears, and mouth were applied, and finally a hanging loop. The hair is made of a thin layer of purple (seeming black) glass. The eyes are very large and are made of concentric overlapping disks of dark purple, white, and purple glass of gradually smaller diameter, allowing all to be visible. The ears and the mouth are made of glass that appears black, which is at its current condition totally impenetrable to light; its true color thus cannot be distinguished, but it was probably dark purple like the other features. A small loop for suspension, made of dark blue (seeming black) glass, is on top of the head. The same coil of glass continues as a wide band running across the forehead.

Some black, ferrous impurities are visible in the white mass of the pendant.

## Comments and Comparanda

## Description

Dark blue, appearing black, almost cylindrical, rod-formed pendant in the shape of a bearded male head. The face is made of an oval mass of white glass. On it are applied the eyebrows, the eyes, and the nose. The eyes are made of a blue disk over which is a slightly smaller white disk, and a smaller disk of dark blue glass renders the pupil. The eyebrows and the nose are made of a single applied, curving thread of glass. The end of the nose is a tiny yellow bead. Lips are rendered with a disk of yellowish glass pressed in the middle to form the mouth. The elongated beard was made of five coils of amber-colored glass; the first from the right is not preserved. Four yellow beads in a line on each side of the face. The ears are not indicated. Suspension loop, if it existed, is covered by the gold attachment. The back side of the pendant is notably shorter and the rod hole very wide.

This is displayed as the central pendant of a necklace of Etruscan golden beads. It is attached to a golden cylindrical bead with a stem and hemispherical element from which it hangs. It is not visible how is it suspended: possibly from a loop too, although there is not enough space for one in the gold “cup.”

## Comments and Comparanda

On Punic glass pendants in general see comments on [2003.206](#cat). This example belongs to a subgroup of Punic glass pendants representing male figures with hair or beard formed by coiling glass, dated between 350 and 200 BCE. If the hair of this example was not removed at a later period along with the suspension loop, then that is missing too, meaning the pendant does not correspond to any of the four published variants. If there was coiling hair, it would belong to the group ([[Seefried 1982]], type C.III, pp. 8, 105–116, plate II) characterized by their intense polychromy; these were occasionally made in a very large size, double that of 83.AM.1, which is an average-size example.
