## Description

Milky white half of theatrical mask, set on a light blue ground. Yellow, multilobed hairdo/wig rendered with straight, radiating rows of tiny “black” angular curls in yellow ground all around the head and forehead. These are framed with a single black thick line that follows the shape of the face and externally with two undulating lines set in yellow which forms triangular, crown-like projections at the upper part of the head. Rows of red and cream, eight-petaled rosettes set in white form radiating bands that connect the outer and inner ends of the wig. Three locks extend, freely and partly bent, from the lower end of the wig to the edge of the plaque. Eyebrow, eyelid, eye, and nose outlined in light blue. Wide-open black mouth outlined in red.

## Description

The bull-god is depicted within a frame in the shape of a naos, that is, a portable shrine, the appropriate backdrop for a god. The surviving part of the frame consists of three straight pieces of orange glass, the flat sides and the protruding lintel, where the composite mosaic cane depicting Apis bull was placed. The black and white bull stands against a deep green background, walking to the left on a red groundline. Between his horns is the sacred sun disc of Hathor in red, with a uraeus at the center. On his back is a black and yellow motif, probably the folds of his neck, although possibly the outline of a vulture’s wing, one of the characteristics associated with the Apis bull. In front of the bull stands an indiscernible object, probably a table for offerings. It rests on a biconical pedestal, which is yellow decorated with red lozenges, topped by a white surface with a semicircular yellow object, probably an offering. The area of the bull’s face and the object in front of him is distorted and discolored. The motif is clearly visible on both sides.

Several glass inlays with the Apis bull on them are preserved in various museum collections. None is identical to this particular one, differing in both the combination of colors and the details, such as the table offering.

On the Virginia piece the biconical yellow construction with a red central rod and a hemispherical mass at the center is identical to the one in the JPGM collection. It also has a frame—this one in blue—that might have resembled the shrine lintel in the missing upper part. The ones in the Miho Museum and the Freer Gallery are probably cuts of the same glass rod.

## Condition

The upper and lower ends are broken. The two sides of the band preserve the original edges; small areas with iridescence and pitting. The back side is severely pitted and covered with incrustation.

## Description

Plaque with vertical, floral pattern. On the front side a multicolored floral decoration is encased in yellow glass. The lower part of the motif comprises a truncated conical pot, formed of three red and two black horizontal bands. From the pot stem rise three elongated turquoise leaves outlined in black. Between the leaves are two tall (seemingly black, probably dark red) stems, each topped by a red globular feature/flower that extends higher than the leaves. One of these flowers is square and the other is roughly circular.

One fully preserved and the upper part of a second motif are visible on the extant fragment.

The back side of the plaque is covered with translucent purple glass that fits into a yellow outline along the long sides of the plaque.

## Comments

For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire see comments on [2003.260](#cat).

The band was made in the following way: The cane with the motif on it was sliced and each slice was placed “above” the previous, forming a band. This strap of adjoining slices was reheated and a thin (0.1–0.2 cm) layer of translucent purple glass was applied to it, bonding the slices together into a solid mass. The front side, after assembly into bands of the desired length, was polished. The seam between the two slices that were fused together to form the band is visible just below the bottom of the pot.

## Description

Rectangular inlay, broken on both ends. Front and back sides flat. The design extends through the thickness of the plaque. The upper part is uneven but clear and the motifs are clearly visible. Only the left edge is straight and probably preserves the original edge of the plaque/band.

Part of an elongated decorative band with palmettes, that is, the fan-shaped leaves of a palm tree. In the preserved part the same motif appears partially three times: palmette with six leaves and yellow lanceolate stem standing on two spiral tendrils. The motif is outlined in white glass on a dark blue background, and only the palmette stem is made of opaque yellow glass. The lower preserved palmette differs in the red used in an oval at the upper end of the lanceolate stem and at the outer edges of the petals.

## Condition

Fully preserved. Small part of one edge is missing. There is some discoloration around the edges.

## Description

A rectangular mosaic plaque fragment decorated with a pattern of four-petaled flowers set in opaque red glass, with white petals, outlined in turquoise, around yellow centers. Each tessera consists of two of the petals and the yellow central dot. The end of the tesserae of each row were placed between the lower row’s tesserae, thus forming in a loose manner the pattern of the flower.

The decoration runs through the entire plaque and is clear on the back side too.

One of the sides is mildly curved, apparently meant to be the edge of the original band or decorative motif. The other three sides are vertical, with the lowest 0.2 cm on the bottom edge beveled, which would have facilitated the juxtaposition of similar rectangular plaques.

The quatrefoil motif was used for millennia in ancient Egypt in connection with the goddesses Isis and Nephthys, represented also on mummy-shaped divine figures and on beaded mummy nets. In the Ptolemaic period it was translated into mosaic glass. It appears that originally it represented stars and not flowers. In only a few cases, like in the example from JPGM, do the quatrefoils have a yellow central rod, probably recalling the central gold nail of ancient cloisonné work ([[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], p. 400, no. 143).

This piece was probably part of a garment of a figurine, given the motif and the curved side, as in [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011]], p. 380, no. 618.

Plaque with floral decoration. Set on a translucent dark green-blue ground, the following motifs are discernible: one green and yellow poppy-like lotus fruit; a quatrefoil rosette formed by sequential layers red from center to outer edge of yellow, white, and red glass; a six-petal white flower with yellow center. Preserves a small part of the original straight edge of the plaque.

On the back side are visible the reinforcements of irregular pieces of ribbed glass on the back of the different florets that comprise the decorative theme.

##  Comments and Comparanda

For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire see comments on [2003.260](#cat) and [2004.26.2](#cat).

This object is part of the largest known group of mosaic plaques, those decorated with floral motifs. They are almost exclusively found in Egypt, where they were made between the end of the first century BCE and the early first century CE. It has been estimated that the plaques were rectangles about 12–15 cm in height and 6–7 cm in width. The front side of the plaques is always ground and polished ([[Grose 1989]], pp. 355–356). The motifs extend through the thickness, and the back side is partially covered by a backing of waste and chips of mosaic glass. The plaques adorned architectural elements and furniture. Two groups are distinguished on the basis of their quality: first, the finer and rarer one, with a translucent cobalt blue or dark blue ground and carefully executed mosaic motifs; the second group, which is much more numerous, consists of thicker plaques with a translucent to transparent greenish-blue ground with the motifs less regularly shaped and the backings usually made from a crude, uneven matrix of short, rectangular cane lengths.

Among the pieces in the JPGM collection those on dark blue background prevail, with five examples ([76.AF.70.37](#num), [76.AF.70.38](#num), [76.AF.70.40](#num), [76.AF.70.42](#num), [83.AF.28.21](#num)), and those on greenish background number only two ([2004.26.2](#cat), [2004.26.5](#cat)) .The plants depicted are mostly lotus stalks and flowers ([Nelumbo nucifera]{.underline}), ears of wheat, a bunch of grapes, all in profile; a four-petaled red and white flower, a star-shaped white flower, white and yellow circles, all three motifs as would be viewed from above.

Mosaic inlay with floral motif. The basic motif, set in a checkerboard pattern, consists of a flower with four triangular green petals outlined in yellow, set in a red square with concave sides framed by four blue ovals outlined in white. Each tessera is lozenge-shaped, and along each center is placed the oval motif that stretches to the two corners. On each of the other two corners is a green triangle set in yellow. Four such tesserae form the quatrefoil flower motif, framed by ovals, which is set in a checkerboard pattern that covers the plaque.

Back side mainly murky green with some red areas only partly visible.

Square tile.

## Description

A kind of checkerboard motif covers the plaque, on which are preserved 27 columns with 23 rows. The background contains square gray tesserae (1.5 × 1.5 cm) and slightly smaller light gray (ca. 1.2 × 1.2 cm) ones, which appear every few (two to six) rows. Aligned with the light gray tesserae are fifteen mosaic tesserae present in six rows; these are four times larger (3.4 × 3.4 cm) than the gray ones, and they form a loose network of lozenges. In each mosaic tessera, a freely designed, four-petaled rosette is set in a red square background, which is set diagonally in a white square. The petals are formed by white and black (translucent purple?) curved lines. The mosaic tesserae are aligned with lighter gray tesserae every few rows of darker gray tesserae, which form the main background.

## Description

Free-formed mosaic glass snake made up of sections of glass. Curvilinear body of a snake, hemispherical in cross section, underside flat but uneven. Yellow marvered trails were applied on the body (which may be modern) to represent the scales. The head in its current condition is in profile and is made of dark blue canes embedded in opaque white glass, with a section of axially cut opaque white for the mouth and a section of black for the pupil of the eye.

## Comments and Comparanda

This is a rare surviving product of modeled Roman glass, consisting of colored threads marvered into a colorless or lightly colored matrix and tooled into a serpentine, wavy shape. In its original form it showed the lozenge-shaped head of the reptile from above, as the rest of the body is presented. The single fully preserved known example ([[Miho Museum 2001]], p. 96, no. 128 \[A. Yoko\]: H. 13, W. 10.6 cm, reddish brown glass wrapped in white and pale blue cords of glass) has its body curling into two large folds, assuming an approximately figure eight–shaped form that is evident in other partly preserved examples (Corning 1962, p. 8, fig. 5; [[Goldstein 1979]], pp. 212–213, nos. 601–604; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 359, 372, nos. 678–680; also, New Orleans Museum of Art 69.79, illustrated in [[Grose 1989]], p. 359, fig. 174). Finally, six partly preserved examples, possibly included among the previously mentioned examples, were part of the Collection Julien Gréau, bought by Pierpont Morgan and donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art ([[Froehner 1903]], plate LXXI, nos. 10–15).

The exact use is not known, but the flat underside indicates that it was or could have been used as a decorative inlay in furniture or an architectural element. It seems logical to connect this statuette with depictions of Agathodaimon, a lesser god in the form of a a benevolent serpent. In urban contexts it appears as a household god, protector of the home in which it was worshiped. Agathodaimon in different contexts was a guarantor of agrarian fertility ([LIMC]{.underline} I, pp. 277–282, s.v. “Agathodaimon” by F. Dunand).

## Condition

Single fragment. The surface is slightly pitted.

## Description

The head and upper body of a multicolored fish appear against a turquoise background. All the colorful elements of the motif are a form of incrustation (Th. ca. 1 mm), set in the turquoise ground (Th. 2 cm) of the plaque. Originally the decoration was thicker too, but it was polished, probably in antiquity, as the pitting on the front surface indicates. Most probably the multicolored features of the fish were arranged on a surface and then the turquoise layer was applied over them. The back side is anomalous, uneven and rough, with elongated indentations, tooling marks of the production procedure.

The lower part of the fish is turquoise and outlined with a white band. The upper part has also green areas and is outlined with dark blue. A vertical wavy band of three red and two thinner dark green stripes indicated the gill slits. A wide white band delineates either the end of the head or some striping of the actual fish species rendered on the plaque. The fins are very long, and they are made of a series of wider green and fine dark green, yellow, and red stripes, outlined with a fine red stripe. The eye is made of a wide green oval with a small white triangle, which renders the reflection of the light in the pupil, surrounded with fine yellow and red rings. It seems that the fish represented can be identified as a tuna.

## Comments and Comparanda

The fish most resembles the yellowfin tuna in the colors of the body and the fins, in addition to their characteristic elongated form and the shape of the head. This species has its habitat in the Atlantic Ocean; there are other species of tuna that migrate in the Mediterranean, especially bluefin tuna, which is known to have been fished from prehistoric times and in a more organized fashion at least from the sixth century BCE by Phoenicians on the Atlantic and in the Western Mediterranean and by Greeks in the Black Sea, even appearing on third- and second-century BCE coins minted in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, and Asia Minor, showing the economic importance of this trade in that period ([[Mastromarco 1988]]; [[Curtis 2005]]; [[Pepe 2006]]; [[Di Natale 2012]]; [[Di Natale 2014]]).

Fragments of several inlay plaques and plates with fish motifs are known, apparently products of a specialized workshop; it has even been proposed that they were sold as half-products for use by glassworkers and other artisans ([[Weinberg and Stern 2009]], p. 86). Published parallels include the following: finds from Athenian Agora, dated around the middle of the third century CE ([[Weinberg 1962]], pp. 29–36; [[Brill 1962]], pp. 37–48; [[Weinberg and Stern 2009]], pp. 84–86, no. 153); Corinth, dated in the third century CE ([[Williams and Zervos 1982]], pp. 133–134, plates 42a, 43; [[Oliver 2001]]; [[Antonaras 2022]], pp. 71–73, no. 447); Rimini, dated in the third century CE ([[Ortalli 2000]], pp. 516, 519–520, no. 183); Narbone, dated in the third century CE ([[Feugère 2001]], pp. 15–16, fig. 5); Lechaion ([[Ibrahim, Scranton and Brill 1976]], panels 16–17, pp. 72, 86, figs. 31, 87, 88, 91, 92).

Wide, wavy bands of red, light green divided by three fine dark green lines and white glass. On one edge of this band a short, bending, applied, red feature is preserved.

## Comments and Comparanda

Possibly part of a maritime presentation, part of the body of a fish. Probably from the same object as [76.AF.70.16](#num) although that piece is thicker (Th. 0.5 cm). For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire see comments at [2003.260](#cat) and [2004.26.2](#cat).

On the back side the motifs are clearly visible, undistorted.

## Comments and Comparanda

For the historical and technological evolution of glass inlays in Pharaonic Egypt and the Roman Empire see comments on [2003.260](#cat) and [2004.26.2](#cat). Of glass panels and vessels with mosaic fish motifs see comments and parallels cited for [2003.266](#cat).

In the rendering of the scales, the colors of the fins, and even the white outline of the body, 83.AF.28.26 is connected directly with fragments in the Corning Museum of Glass ([[ 1979]], p. 265, no. 794, plate 35; [[Harden et al. 1987]], p. 31, no. 9) and in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (<https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/570436>; <https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551563>).; [[Harden et al. 1987]], p. 31, no. 9: https://www.cmog.org/artwork/revetment-fish?image=0) and in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (<https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/570436>; <https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/551563>).
