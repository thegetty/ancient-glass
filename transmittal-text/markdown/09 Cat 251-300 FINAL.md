## Description

Cracked-off and ground, mildly flaring rim; hemispherical body, standing on a flat bottom. Beneath the rim is a fine, horizontal wheel-cut groove. At mid-body height, another groove, below which is arranged a row of 26 wide, oval, wheel-cut incisions. Further below is a row of 11 horizontally arranged, oval wheel-cut incisions flanked by two grooves. Six radiantly arranged oval wheel-cut incisions form a star-shaped motif at the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

The vessel is made of decolorized glass, which was much more valuable and expensive than ordinary greenish glass. In Roman times glass decolorized with manganese or antimony appears from the last third of the first century CE until the beginning of the fourth century CE, but it was most in fashion and had its highest distribution levels from the second quarter of the second to the mid-third century, which is exactly the production period of this flask. It was used mainly in western Europe and mostly for tableware, although bottles and unguentaria appear among them as well ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 1, pp. xiii–xvii; {Stern 2020}, pp. 769–774).

## Description

Rough, cracked-off, vertical rim; deep, truncated, conical body with convex walls, tapering gradually toward the flat bottom. No pontil mark visible on the bottom. A pair of fine, horizontal grooves—2 cm beneath the rim and a single wide groove 4 cm lower—form a wide register within which are arranged two large oval blue blobs and two groups of four smaller, round blue blobs forming a lozenge.

## Comments and Comparanda

Hemispherical bowls with unworked rim, slightly everted; hemispherical or even deeper body; flat base; and flat, occasionally slightly concave bottom are a very widely distributed form of glass vessels. They appear from the third century CE, and they were most widely distributed during the fourth century, surviving into the fifth century ({Isings 1957}, pp. 113–114, 131–133, form 96; {Goethert-Polaschek 1977}, form 49a, pp. 50–59; {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 60–63, form 12). The majority are undecorated, but there are many examples bearing engraved wheel-cut decoration with geometrical and figural representations, and there are examples with applied decoration consisting occasionally of blue threads and mostly of blue blobs. This last type of decoration includes the [potoria gemmata]{.underline}, expensive metal vessels decorated with enamel or with semiprecious stones and/or with colorful glass gems ({Fremersdorf 1962}, p. 11). This subgroup of the hemispherical bowls is known both in the east and the west ({Isings 1957}, p. 133, form 96b2; {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 62–63, form 12ii.3, wherein numerous dated comparanda are cited). The decoration is made while the vessel was still attached to the blowpipe and still adequately warm; it was marvered on a marble surface where lumps of glass were arranged in such a way that once they were attached to the vessel they would form the desired motif. After that the vessel was reheated to polish the surface and render the blobs shiny and smooth. Another probable method of applying blobs was by touching the heated tip of a rod of glass briefly onto the vessel and then swiftly removing it. After this procedure was repeated as many times as necessary to create the desired motifs, the vessel was reheated and the blobs smoothened. Mainly dark-blue blobs were used for the decoration, occasionally supplemented by red and green ones. They were arranged around the body of the vessel in a single or a double row, or in triangular formations, occasionally alternating with large single blobs. Published parallels include the following: {Calvi 1968}, plate 26:4–5; {Goethert-Polaschek 1977}, pp. 50–62, forms 49a–d, nos. 188, 210, 233–234, 268, plates 38–39, 41; {Arveiller-Dulong and Arveiller 1985}, pp. 112–113, nos. 209–210; {Harden et al. 1987}, p. 113, no. 46; {Barkóczi 1988}, pp. 97–98, nos. 146, 147, plate XIII; {Sazanov 1995}, pp. 332–333; {Cohen 1997}, p. 408, plate III:6; {Whitehouse 1997a}, p. 216, no. 371; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 136, no. 136.

## Description

Flaring rim; elongated ovoid body; conical base. The entire vessel bears wheel-cut decoration. There are two parallel incisions below the lip, followed by a wide smooth band on the transition to the body that is delineated by a relief rib. The main body area is covered with three rows of lozenge-shaped facets, forming a very regular and tight faceted pattern. The top and bottom rows have rounded upper ends. Below this band there is a wide, smooth band, that has eliminated the ending of the bottom row of facets; this band is delineated at the bottom by a high and angular rib. The edge of the base is also carefully cut, at an angle. At the center of the bottom there is a raised ring (W. 0.55 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

The vessel is made of decolorized glass, which was much more valuable and expensive than ordinary greenish glass. In Roman times, glass decolorized with manganese or antimony appears from the last third of the first century CE until the beginning of the fourth century CE, but it was most in fashion and had its highest distribution levels from the second quarter of the second to the mid-third century. It was used mainly in western Europe and mostly for tableware, although bottles and unguentaria appear in colorless glass as well ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 1, pp. xiii–xvii; {Stern 2020}, pp. 769–774).

This beaker belongs to a group of possibly molded, probably blown and polished vessels, comprising conical and ovoid beakers, bowls, jars, and spoons, that are all made of thick decolorized glass ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 1, pp. 13–14). The technique of facet-cutting on glass was invented in Italy in the late 60s or early 70s, when transparent colorless glass became fashionable; facets are clearly visible on transparent glass and thus the result was much appreciated. In particular, ovoid beakers—sometimes elongated like 96.AF.320 and sometimes almost spherical—decorated at the center of the body with oval, circular, or lozenge facets flanked by flat or protruding zones are dated to the late first through early second century CE, and all published examples are found in the western and northern provinces of the Roman Empire ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 1, pp. 26–27, form IN 18).

## Condition

This beaker is severely weathered. Its surface bears extensive iridescence, dark accretions, and flaking.

## Description

Cut-off, probably mildly polished rim; conical body, standing on a low, slightly protruding bottom.

The vessel is decorated with wheel-cutting. Two parallel, horizontal grooves form a rib between them at mid-body height. Another set of grooves form a rib at the lower end of the body. The base is conical, wheel-cut as well. The bottom is wheel-cut at its perimeter, leaving a central raised disc (Diam. 2.5 cm). In addition, some anomalies at the center of the bottom might be interpreted as a pontil scar (1 × 0.9 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

In Roman times glass decolorized with manganese or antimony appears from the last third of the first century CE until the beginning of the fourth century CE, but it was most in fashion and had its highest distribution levels from the second quarter of the second to the mid-third century.

## Comments and Comparanda

Acquired with the bowl [2003.379.2](#num). This shape of beaker is known from several sites, mostly western Roman Empire ({Isings 1957}, p. 51, form 36b; {Whitehouse 1997a}, p. 228, no. 387; {von Saldern 1980b}, p. 118, no. 117; {Fünfschilling 2005}, pp. 310–311, form AR 42). Furthermore, beakers with slightly different bell-shaped body but with applied conical base and thread around the neck are known from Milan ({Roffia 1993}, pp. 89, 92, no. 79) and Croatia ({Alfano 1997}, p. 198, no. 203). Also, very similar beakers with the same body but with folded base are known from Samothrace ({Dusenbery 1967}, p. 46, no. 42)and Crete ({von Saldern 1968}, no. 54) as well as unknown provenances ({Auth 1976}, p. 206, no. 376; {Matheson 1980}, p. 42, no. 113; {Hayes 1975}, p. 57, no. 137, fig. 3, plate 10).

Three bands (W. 0.5 cm) of fine horizontal incisions divide the surface of the vessel into three registers, roughly equal in height.

## Comments and Comparanda

This beaker belongs to a well-known first-century CE form of with ground rim and cylindrical, ovoid, and truncated conical body ({Isings 1957}, p. 44, form 29; {Rütti 1991}, form AR 35; {Stern 2001}, pp. 46, 77, no. 19; {Antonaras 2017}, p. 74, form 25). They appear in the Augustan period (27 BCE–14 CE), but the majority of the extant examples date to the reign of Tiberius or Claudius (14–54 CE), and they continue to be produced into the third quarter of the first century ({Cool and Price 1995}, pp. 68–69; {Stern 2001}, pp. 46, 79–80). It seems that this form imitates fine eggshell pottery vessels, which appear as early as the second quarter of the first century BCE ({Robinson 1959}, pp. 11–13, no. F18, F19, plate 1, group F), and that they were produced in Italy and the northwestern provinces.

## Comments and Comparanda

This particular form of beaker is probably a descendant of the mid-imperial (second–third centuries) indented beakers without a base-ring known from eastern Mediterranean sites ({Isings 1957}, pp. 49–50, form 35; Cyprus: {Vessberg 1956}, beaker type IV.α.2., pp. 142–143, fig. 44:34; {Lightfoot 2007}, pp. 92–97, nos. 77–83; Thera: {Dragendorff et al. 1903}, p. 286 fig. 481:t–u). Published examples with pushed-in, conical base are known from Cologne ({La Baume and Salomonson 1976}, no. 161); Hungary ({Barkóczi 1988}, p. 87, no. 117, plate XI.LXXV); Türkiye ({Akat, Fıratlı and Kocabaş 1984}, no. 291), Myrina ({Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 450, no. 1264, plate 112); as well as two that are unprovenanced ({Whitehouse 1997a}, p. 113, no. 173; {Israeli 2003}, p. 163, no. 171). In addition, a flask from Syria, dated to the third–fourth centuries, is essentially a narrow and slender variant of this form ({Kunina 1997}, p. 333, no. 403).

## Comments and Comparanda

This beaker is a rare variant of well-known first-century glass beakers ({Isings 1957}, pp. 47–50, forms 33, 35), differing in the pinched, vertical ribs. It seems that it is quite rare and the only really close parallel was found in Aquincum, Hungary ({Barkóczi 1988}, p. 91, no. 129, plates XII, LXXV) from a grave dated to the early second century CE. Also, cf. {Loeschke, Niessen, and Willers 1911}, plate XLIV: 1109, a ribbed beaker with additional horizontal threads.

A fine thread is carelessly wound twice, 2 cm below the rim. An annular pontil mark (W. 1.4, Th. 0.4 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

In general this form of beaker probably derives from the beakers with applied decoration with pushed-in base that were in fashion in western Europe from the middle of the first century to the early second century CE ({Isings 1957}, pp. 47–48, form 33; {Berger 1960}, p. 47, plate 7; {Cool and Price 1995}, p. 71; {Ravagnan 1994}, n. 248, p. 131). True parallels are known from Hungary ({Barkóczi 1988}, p. 91, no. 128, plate XI, LXXV), dating to the third century CE. Also, examples with the lower ends of the decoration freely hanging are known from Cologne ({Fremersdorf 1959}, pp. 71–72, plates 108, 109; {Doppelfeld 1966}, pp. 58–59, plate 132) dated to the third–fourth centuries. CE In addition, an unprovenanced parallel in the Corning Museum of Art has published ({Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 137, no. 675).

Faint pontil mark (W. ca. 0.8 cm) is visible on the undersurface of the base .

## Comments and Comparanda

Free-blown stemmed goblets appear from the first century CE, with several fine, ornate examples extant ({Isings 1957}, pp. 50–52, 56, forms 36, 40). Stemmed beakers were re-introduced in the Early Byzantine period (fifth–seventh centuries), probably sometime in the fifth century; these were simple utilitarian vessels, mostly undecorated, used as drinking vessels and lamps ({Isings 1957}, pp. 139–140, form 111; {Antonaras 2009}, pp. 162–167, form 35 = {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 82–83). Stemmed beakers are the most widespread form of glass vessel in the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea region from the fifth century and at least until the seventh century CE ({Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 33, type V:9; {Dussart 1998}, pp. 115–120, type B.IX.1, plates 27–28; {Stern 2001}, pp. 310–311, nos. 173–174; {Israeli 2003}, p. 198, no. 237; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 139, nos. 192–193). The broad distribution and the variations in the shape of the body and the base indicate that stemmed beakers were produced in many places ({Foy 1995}, pp. 208–209, form 23a; {Sternini 1995a}, p. 257; {Antonaras 2010b}; {Antonaras 2014a}). It seems that their production underwent a great expansion when glassblowers devised a method to form the entire vessel from a single mass of glass ({Stern 2001}, pp. 270–271; {Weinberg and Stern 2009}, pp. 148–149). The lower part of the \[\[paraison\]\] was folded in and squeezed to form the base and the stem quite quickly ({Antonaras 2009b}, pp. 162–167, form 35 = {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 82–83). This new technique required much less glass than the earlier technique, in which the bowl and the base of the vessel were made from two different \[\[paraisons\]\] ({Antonaras 2009b}, pp. 165–166, form 37 = {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 85–87). Stemmed beakers are found in great numbers in the excavations of churches, where they were apparently used chiefly as lamps ({Antonaras 2007}, pp. 51–54; {Antonaras 2014b}, pp. 100–101, 103).

Good condition. Large fills have been added on the base.

## Description

The lip is fire-polished and rounded, and it turns inward. The mastoid body rests, a little bit off-center, on a conical applied base. There is no pontil mark visible on the bottom of the base.

Two angular handles with two horizontal plates (M-shaped) have been applied on the lower part of the body and drawn up to the rim. Each handle starts as a flat band at lower body, goes up, and reaches the rim. There it is bent at a right angle, continues horizontally, and is pressed to form a thumb-rest tab. Then it continues vertically, and at mid-height is pressed, forming an angular shape; at lower end it is pinched to form a smaller tab, and finally it is attached to the body on the middle of the underlying band.

## Comments and Comparanda

Glass skyphoi first appear in the second century BCE, and by the late first century BCE–early first century CE they were produced and decorated in several techniques, creating luxurious products. For examples of glass skyphoi in luxurious techniques, including molded mosaic, translucent monochrome, and colorless glass, see {Oliver 1967}, pp. 27–33. A glass cameo example, probably the most luxurious extant example, is [84.AF.85](#num); see {Harden et al. 1987}, pp. 68–69, no. 31. An overview of Hellenistic glass skyphoi has been presented by Marie-Dominique Nenna ({Nenna 1999}, pp. 100–101, with further bibliography).

Free-blown skyphoi, shallow and cylindrical or deep and ovoid, both on low ring-bases, appear in the Tiberian period and continue into the Flavian. They are reminiscent of contemporaneous silver vessels ({Zampieri 1998}, p. 176 for further bibliography; {Lapatin et al. 2014}, pp. 46–51). They are a relatively wide-distributed form known mostly in the western provinces of the Roman empire ({Isings 1957}, pp. 55–56, form 39; {Czurda-Ruth 1979}, p. 56, no. 190; {van Lith 1991}; {Fünfschilling 2015}, p. 372, form AR 97; {Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 199, nos. 544–545; {Zampieri 1998}, p. 178, no. 293; {Sternini 1991}, pp. 144–145, nos. 547, 577, plate 55), Greece ({Davidson 1952}, p. 103, nos. 649, 650, figs. 9, 10; {Wright 1980}, p. 163, no. 126, fig. 8; {Weinberg and Stern 2009}, pp. 54–55; [ArchDelt]{.underline} B΄3 (1965 \[1968\]), p. 566, plate 710) and Asia Minor ({Goldman 1950}, p. 401, no. 14). Typically the ends of the angular handles are pinched flat and on them a few glassblowers stamped with pincers their name and occasionally added their origin, Sidon ({Stern 1995}, pp. 68–69).

Fine applied conical base with sharp, vertical ending. No pontil mark visible on the undersurface of the base.

Two dark blue, twisted coil handles start on upper body and are reattached at lower body, where they continue as a flat, slim trail all the way to the upper part of the base.

## Comments and Comparanda

A form of drinking vessel represented among early imperial Roman glassware is the kantharos ({Hilgers 1969}, pp. 46–48, 136–138). These two-handled cups, intended to be used for drinking wine, are known in three basic variants in the first century CE, mostly dated to the first part of the century: cups with handles curved high above the rim, which stand either on a stemmed base or on a ring-base, and cups with low handles that begin under the rim and do not rise above it ({Isings 1957}, pp. 53–54, forms 38a, b, and c, respectively). The particular form like 84.AF.30 was probably produced in Italy ({Isings 1957}, p. 53, form 38a); on the distribution of first-century kantharoi with stemmed bases, see {van Lith 1991}, pp. 99–110. Published finds include: {Isings 1957}, p. 53, from Pompeii; {Ravagnan 1994}, p. 203, no. 399, second half of the first century CE, from Zara; {Mandruzzato and Marcante 2005}, pp. 43, 50, 107–108, nos. 300, 301, from Aquileia, dated to the first century CE and ascribed to an Italian workshop. Cf. also {Bonomi 1996}, p. 168, no. 377, from Adria, dated to the second quarter of the first century CE; {Zampieri 1998}, p. 178, no. 292, first century CE from Padua; {Fünfschilling 2015}, p. 369, form AR 91, first century, from Augst; {Bonnet Borel 1997}, p. 36, from Avenches, dated between 20 and 60 CE.

## Comments and Comparanda

Small glass amphoras rendering in miniature the shape of large clay amphoras were quite popular and were used as tableware for serving wine. This vessel belongs to a distinctive group of Syro-Palestinian glass table amphoras, appearing in four different types, which have been dated to the fourth and fifth centuries CE ({Stern 1977}, pp. 84–85). This particular vessel, due to its tall, tubular neck that is not constricted at its base, is ascribed to type I or II. The slightly flaring rim led us to ascribe it to the rarer type II. On the basis of its long, conical body, the absence of a base, the presence of a decorative coil halfway down neck, it is ascribed to type IIA2a ({Stern 1977}, pp. 84–85). The findspots indicate that they may have been produced in Syria, possibly in the fourth century CE ({Hayes 1975}, p. 110, no. 411, plate 25; {Stern 1977}, pp. 84–85, type IIA2a; {Stern 2001}, no. 98, p. 208; {Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 37, type 10.2; {Dekoulakou 1976}, p. 103, plate 81:β, γ; {Papageorgiou 2014}, p. 447, no. 130; cf. {Matheson 1980}, pp. 86–87, no. 234; {Weinberg and Stern 2009}, pp. 150–151, no. 356; {Williams and Zervos 1983}, p. 24, no. 64, plate 10; {Antonaras 2022}, pp. 67–68, 118, nos. 431–432.

## Description

Fire-polished rim; conical mouth; cylindrical neck; globular body; mildly concave bottom. A blue coil circles once, forming an applied base-ring and continues toward the center of the bottom, where it forms a central circle 1.7 cm wide.

Two fine blue threads are wound around the neck and at the transition from mouth to neck. The vessel has snake-thread floral decoration realized with applied threads in blue and white glass; on one side the blue motifs prevail, and on the other the white motifs. The narrow, undulating parts of the threads, which represent the stems and stalks, are left undecorated. The wider parts of the threads, representing oval, pointed leaves, bear cross-hatched, impressed decoration.

## Comment and Comparanda

The vessel is made of decolorized glass, which was much more valuable and expensive than ordinary greenish glass. In Roman times glass decolorized with manganese or antimony appears from the last third of the first century CE until the beginning of the fourth century CE, but it was most in fashion and had its highest distribution levels from the second quarter of the second to the mid-third century, which is exactly the production period of this flask. It was used mainly in western Europe and mostly for tableware, although bottles and unguentaria appear in colorless glass as well ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 1, pp. xiii–xvii; {Stern 2020}, pp. 769–774). This particular flask form appears mainly in the western provinces but occasionally in the Mediterranean region as well; plain examples appear from the middle of the second century CE, and those with snake-thread decoration from the late second to the middle of the third century ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 2, pp. 242–244, forms IN 242–243).

Snake-thread vessels were first produced in late second century CE in the eastern Mediterranean, and the technique was transported soon after to the western provinces, where at least two workshops were active, one in Rhineland and the other in Pannonia ({Harden et al. 1987}, pp. 105–108; {Stern 2001}, p. 138; {Dévai 2019}, pp. 325–329). The vessels are grouped stylistically: those with freely applied trails, and the “flower and bird” variety, named after its representations. Eastern examples are made of and mostly decorated with colorless glass; the trails bear often crosshatched lines; and the “flower and bird” pattern is found only among them ({Barag 1969}, pp. 55–66). Colored trails appear in the decoration of western products much more often. The trails are usually smooth; when they are not, they bear oblique lines, not crosshatched.

The vessel under study presents features of products from both regions. The shape of the body finds its closest parallels in Cologne ({Fremersdorf 1959}, p. 42, N 119, plate 20; p. 49, N 6049, plate 48); the decoration, in “flower and bird” style with crosshatched leaves, however, ascribes the vessel quite securely to an eastern workshop.

## Description

Cut-off, vertical rim; cylindrical neck with a constriction at its base; squat globular body; fine base-ring; mildly concave bottom. Five irregular, oval, horizontal indentations are arranged at regular intervals around the body at its widest part. A slight variation in the weathering below the rim indicates the faint remains of an incised band. A wide incised band, 0.5 cm wide, is visible around the base-ring.

## Comparanda

The vessel is made of decolorized glass, which was much more valuable and expensive than ordinary greenish glass. In Roman times, glass decolorized with manganese or antimony appears from the last third of the first century CE until the beginning of the fourth century, but it was most in fashion and had its highest distribution levels from the second quarter of the second to the mid-third century. It was used mainly in western Europe and mostly for tableware, although bottles and unguentaria appear among in colorless glass as well ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 1, pp. xiii–xvii; {Stern 2020}, pp. 769–774). This particular form appears mainly in the western provinces and might originate from the area of the Rhine. It appears in two variants ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 2, p. 249, form IN 249): one without a base, standing on its bottom ({Fremersdorf and Polónyi-Fremersdorf 1984}, no. 129); the second variant has a pushed-in ring-base like 2003.408 ({Isings 1971}, no. 22, plate 2; {Kunina 1997}, pp. 298–299, no. 223; {La Baume and Salomonson 1976}, p. 50, no. 142 and plate 18). Occasionally they are decorated with faint horizontal incised bands.

Cut-off, vertical rim; cylindrical neck with a constriction at its base; squat body; fine, pinched ring-base; flat bottom. Bears faint incised decoration. A fine horizontal band around the rim, one 0.5 cm below it, two more at mid-neck height; three concentric bands (W. 00.2, 1, 0.5 cm, respectively) on the upper body, and one more (W. 0.2 cm) on the lower body.

## Comments and Comparanda

This form is very close to a widely distributed spherical flask form like [2004.39](#num) ({Isings 1957}, pp. 121–122, form 103; {Antonaras 2009}, pp. 190–92, form 50) regarding the shaping of the rim and neck, their main difference being that the originally spherical body was pressed to flattened into a lentoid shape. In addition to the fine incising some examples are decorated with indentations around the body, also known in decolorized glass ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 2, p. 249, IN 249). Examples with a pushed-in ring-base, like 2003.390, and others without a base are known, and they are made either of greenish or decolorized glass ({Fremersdorf and Polónyi-Fremersdorf 1984}, p. 53, no. 129 \[example without base\]; {Doppelfeld 1966}, p. 52, plates 98–99 \[four examples with pushed-in ring-base\]; {Kunina 1997}, pp. 298–299, no. 223 \]example with pushed-in ring-base\]). They are dated to the third century CE, and it has been assumed that they are products of the Rhine region.

The vessel has engraved decoration. An inscription written in double-lined, capital, Greek letters, ΥΓΙΑ (“Health”). Five slanting, parallel strokes cover the area between the last and the first letter of the word. In addition, the area above the inscription is covered with slanting strokes.

## Comments and Comparanda

This flask belongs to a quite diverse group of vessels, which include several different shapes—beakers, shallow bowls or dishes, globular flasks or bottles, and one jug—that were decorated with incised decoration and inscriptions with double-line lettering. Finds are dated between the third and fifth centuries CE, mostly to the fourth century CE. The finds are widely distributed, and it has been proposed that they were produced in a number of dispersed workshops, predominantly in the eastern Mediterranean, namely, goblets in Egypt, and flasks and bowls in western Asia Minor but also probably Cologne ({Fremersdorf 1967}, pp. 105–108, plates 104–109; {Harden 1967/8}, pp. 43–55; {Grose 1985}, pp. 23–28; {Stern 2001}, pp. 137–138, 160–161; {Lightfoot 2013b}, pp. 358–362; {Hill and Nenna 2003}, p. 90, fig. 4:1, 2; {Keller 2006}, pp. 118, 211–212, plate 12).

## Description

Fire-polished, rounded, flaring rim; conical mouth; cylindrical neck, widening toward the body; conical body with rounded carination that curves in toward the tubular, folded base-ring. A fine thread of greenish glass wound spirally five times on the lower part of the neck. A circular scar (W. 0.9 cm) of a solid pontil is visible on the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

Flasks with similar carinated bodies are known in variants, usually standing on a ring-base and very often decorated with a simple, fine thread wound around the neck. At least some of them are considered products of Cyprus ({Vessberg 1952}, p. 135, flask type B.I, plate VIII:1–2), and they are found mainly in eastern Mediterranean sites, dated to the second–third centuries CE ({Hayes 1975}, p. 67, no. 201, fig. 6, plate 15, without base-ring; {Spartz 1967}, nos. 85–86, plate 19; {Auth 1976}, p. 124, no. 154; {Kunina 1997}, p. 299, no. 224; {Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 166, no. 695; {Stern 2001}, pp. 148, 212–213, no. 102, without base; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 173, no. 226).

## Description

Fish-shaped flask. The vessel has in-folded, slightly flaring rim; cylindrical neck; and originally oval body and flat bottom. The vessel body was pressed and formed into the body of the fish, and the neck was bent to form the tail of the fish. The bottom was pinched into two protruding sections for lips, probably to identify the aquatic creature with a dolphin, with the long lips representing dolphin’s rostrum. A trail of glass was wound four times around the upper part of the vessel neck. A coil of glass was applied along the upper flattened edge body and pinched in regular intervals, forming the dorsal fin. Along the wide sides of the body are four pinched ridges at equal distances. A vertically applied coil delineates the edge of the head. The eyes are applied blobs of glass. Toward the end of the body, on either side, one sizable blob of glass was applied and pinched to form a bent strap that might indicate some fictional anatomical feature or, more probably, might each serve as a lug or small handle to hang or handle the vessel.

## Comments and Comparanda

The vessel is quite probably made of decolorized glass, which was much more valuable and expensive than ordinary greenish glass. In Roman times glass decolorized with manganese or antimony appears from the last third of the first century CE until the beginning of the fourth century, but it was most in fashion and had its highest distribution levels from the second quarter of the second to the mid-third century, which corresponds with the proposed production period of this flask. It was used mainly in western Europe and mostly for tableware, although bottles and unguentaria appear among them as well ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 1, pp. xiii–xvii; {Stern 2020}, pp. 769–774). This particular variant of fish-flask form ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 2. pp. 319–320, form IN 315 Var. c) has been recovered from the eastern Mediterranean region, where it was probably produced. Provenanced finds are reported from Syria ({Abdul-Hak and Abdul-Hak 1951}, p. 111, no. 5, plate L, fig. 2, from Tafas-Turbet el Ash’ari; {Kunina 1997}, p. 294, no. 201, E 1359); another was acquired in Lebanon ({Whitehouse 2001a}, pp. 199–200, no. 754 \[with slightly different rim\], Corning Museum of Glass 55.1.94); another is said to be from Palestine ({MMA 1915}, p. 95, acc. no. 15.43.168), while a few other examples do not have recorded find places ({Whitehouse 2001a}, pp. 199–200, no. 755; {[JGS]{.underline} 1969}, p. 110, no. 6 = Silberg collection, Caracas; {Oliver 1980}, p. 98, no. 150, p. 109; {Merrill 1989}, pp. 20, 187, no. 11; {Christie’s 1985}, p. 43, lot 68).

## Condition

Complete. Heavy weathering has given the vessel a mottled gray, brown, and white coloring with an iridescent sheen. Visible breaks in many places.

## Description

Flask in the form of a mouse. The body is teardrop-shaped, with a narrow, curved neck terminating in a spout forming the tail. The head has been formed by pinching to create long ears, small eyes, and a mouth. The feet are applied folded lumps. There is a thread wrapped 1½ times around the tail, which is the mouth of the vessel. There is a solid pontil mark (W. 0.9 cm) on the forehead, which is the bottom of the vessel.

## Comparanda

There are two more glass flasks that render this particular plump-bodied quadruped ({Christie’s 1985}, p. 44, lots 69, 70), one of which reportedly comes from Syria ({Christie’s 1985}, p. 44, lot 69; {Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 201, no. 756). In addition, there are three similar flasks, one from Egypt ({Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 201, no. 757); one from the eastern Mediterranean ({Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 450, no. 1267); and a third, unprovenanced example with snake-thread decoration, originally from the Kofler-Truniger Collection and now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art ({Zanker et al. 2019}, p. 213, no. 99, acc. no. 2012.479.2).

## Condition

Some discoloration (silver on the exterior, black incrustation covering underlying silver weathering on the interior, particularly areas around the mouth and neck) due to weathering, especially around the inside of the mouth and neck. The upper lip of the animal is missing. One of the rear legs is probably missing, and the cavity has been filled with yellow glass very similar to the original. Small chip is missing from the rim.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim with a cutout fold under the lip, imitating an applied coil. Wide, cylindrical neck, at the bottom of which is a constriction that forms a diaphragm. The body has the shape of a hippopotamus. The wide mouth of the vessel extends from the tail end of the animal. The body is constructed of two bulbous shapes: one for the head and one for the body. A thick coil is wound around the head in front of the ears, framing the face of the animal. The head narrows and ends in a pinched, wide-open mouth. Each leg is formed with a blob of glass that was attached to the body and then squeezed and bent with pincers to form the paw/foot. Each eye was formed by a lump of blue glass, which was twisted to be cut, and the revolution of the glass is visible. The ears are formed by blue lumps attached on the surface and then squeezed to flatten them and achieve their slightly elongated, semicircular shape. A striation in the glass on one side of the body shows the way the vessel was manipulated by the glassblower. The originally round, or rather ovular, body was squeezed toward its lower part, thus being transformed into two oblong, barrel-shaped parts, which represent the body and the head of the animal.

The vessel is made of a very thick mass of translucent, dark greenish glass.

Features are applied: the front feet and a coil encircling the face are in the same-colored glass. The back feet are made of yellow glass; the eyes and ears are of dark blue glass.

## Comments and Comparanda

On sprinkler flasks and their production predominantly in Syria from the third century CE, mainly in the fourth, and probably even into the early fifth century CE, see comments on [71.AF.81](file:///Users/kerrisullivan/Desktop/GP%20Ancient%20Glass%20Antonaras/downloaded/@num). For a somehow similar, mouse-like flask see [2004.43](#num), wherein parallels, also dated to the third–fourth centuries CE.

This type of bottom reduces the capacity of the flask to a mere fraction of what it externally appears to contain. It has been previously interpreted as a stemmed beaker, but the fact that the rim remains open and fully usable indicates that the vessel actually was shaped and finished as a flask. No pontil mark on the bottom, but also no constriction on the base of the neck either.

## Comments and Comparanda

This vessel, with its minuscule capacity and ability to stand on either side, can be regarded as a trinket or trick vessel. A well-dated example from Slovenia dates the form to the second half of the first century CE ({Lazar 2003}, 3.7.3, fig. 33, pp. 103, 108, from a Flavian era grave) and another, contemporaneous one from the ancient necropolis of Zadar in Croatia ({Eterović Borzić and Štefanac 2021}, p. 447, no. 1442). Other examples are published from the Newark Museum ({Auth 1976}, p. 91, no. 98, dated to the first–second century CE) and the Royal Ontario Museum ({Hayes 1975}, p. 53, no. 117, plate 8, dated to probably second or early third century CE). Finally, a vessel similar in concept has been interpreted as a goblet tentatively dated to the fourth–sixth centuries, although an earlier or later date was not excluded; it belongs to the Corning Museum of Glass ({Whitehouse 1997a}, p. 106, no. 159).

## Comments and Comparanda

This flask belongs to a variant of the well-known short-necked, bulbous unguentaria that appear in the first century in all Mediterranean Roman provinces ({Isings 1957}, pp. 22–23, form 6). In this variant the body is considerably more voluminous and the bottom is wider than in some comparable finds from Italy ({De Tommaso 1991}, p. 39, type 4; {Mandruzzato and Marcante 2007}, pp. 65–66, nos. 59–61) and Dalmatia ({Ravagnan 1994}, p. 83, nos. 148–149), all of them dated to the first century CE.

## Condition

Cracked; fully preserved; iridescent; parts of the neck are covered with crust. Some of the ornamental thread is missing.

## Description

Fire-polished, vertical rim; cylindrical neck, constricted toward the body; globular body; flat, slightly concave bottom. Three thick coils are wound around the central part of the neck at equal distances. A fine thread is spirally wound eight times around the central part of the neck and over the three coils.

Inside the body four thin tubular threads from lower body to the shoulder. The three of them remain detached at the lower part of the body. The threads were made with the insertion of a pointed tool into the lower part of the initial \[\[paraison\]\], creating a tubular opening which would end at the inside surface of the shoulder. With further expansion of the vessel the tubular hole would assume the shape of a thread.

## Comparanda

The shape of the rim and neck are characteristic of sixth- and seventh-century Syro-Palestinian products, as are the applied coils and threads ({Stern 2001}, p. 263), all features appearing in 71.AF.85. For the classification of this type of vessel see {Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 43, type 15.22. Provenanced finds include a vessel from an archaeological context of the second half of the seventh century CE at Kourion, Cyprus ({Young 1993}, pp. 44, 47, fig. 8, no. 9); another reportedly from the vicinity of the Sea of Galilee ({Auth 1976}, p. 128, no. 158). At least three unprovenanced examples have been published ({Bomford 1976}, p. 34, no. 159; {Harden et al. 1968}, p. 90, no. 125; {Stern 2001}, pp. 263–264, 266, 268–270, 302, no. 165; {Masterpieces 1968}, p. 90, no. 125, British Museum).

## Comparanda

Several pear-shaped vessels decorated with pinched warts are known from the eastern Mediterranean and they are dated between the fifth and seventh centuries. Parallels include the following: {Whitehouse 2003}, pp. 149–150, no. 1152; {Spartz 1967}, no. 134, plate 32, said to be from Syria; {Auth 1976}, p. 230, nos. 524 and 526; {Matheson 1980}, p. 127, nos. 341, 342, 341, said to be from Syria; {Barakat Gallery 1985}, p. 103, no.

## Description

Flaring, in-folded, tubular rim; short, cylindrical neck; squat globular body; slightly concave bottom. Twelve small, pinched projections around widest diameter. No pontil mark on the bottom. There is a thread of the same-colored glass looped along one side of the interior of the mouth and neck, apparently applied by mistake.

## Comments and Comparanda

Squat globular flasks with a row of pinched warts around their greatest diameter are known from several Syro-Palestinian sites ({Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 43, type 15.33-1; {Delougaz and Haines 1960}, plate 50, no. 9, from a grave at Khirbat al-Karak, sixth to mid-seventh century CE; {Harden 1964}, pp. 53–54, fig. 13, top row, no. 5, from Ajlun, sixth to early seventh c.; {Bauer 1938}, p. 540, no. 87, fig. 28:4, plate 151:a, undecorated example from Jerash; {Stern 2001}, p. 354, no. 201; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 155, no. 218). Also comparable are pinched vessels with tall and wide neck: {Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 43, type XV:27-1 (variant); {Matheson 1980}, p. 111, no. 289; cf. {Gawlikowska and As’ad 1994}, nos. 34–40, plate III:9–17; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 154, no. 214.

material: Opaque white and probably yellow glass

modeling_technique_and_decoration: Free-blown; applied thread; pierced spout

## Condition

Probably intact; it is possible that the spout is mended. Some calcination and pitting.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; fine cylindrical neck; spherical body; flat bottom. No pontil mark visible on the bottom. On the shoulder a conical spout was formed by puncturing and drawing out the body. From lower body to rim a fine thread, probably originally yellow, is spirally wound seven times.

## Comparanda

This flask can be ascribed to a generic form of globular flasks, very widely distributed in the early first century CE ({Isings 1957}, p. 16, form 26a), distinguished though by the spout on its shoulder, which is a feature known in larger, mostly bag-shaped vessels of that time, known as guti (see comments on [2003.381](#num)). The vessel is decorated with a thread that was melted flush with the surface, a feature present in both the eastern and western provinces of the Roman Empire in the first century CE ({Isings 1957}, pp. 22–23, form 6); see comments and parallels for [2003.270](#num).

## Condition

Intact. Iridescence and even black crust cover the interior.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; trefoil mouth, wide, cylindrical neck; body pulled to form a spout at its end, assuming the shape of a bird; mildly concave bottom. The tip of the tail is open and has been open from the beginning, as its fire-rounded tip clearly indicates.

The pouring slit of the trefoil mouth is inconveniently placed over the body, making it difficult to pour the liquid contents of the vessel from there.

## Comments and Comparanda

The actual use of these vessels remains uncertain. There is a testimony in the sources that they were indeed baby feeders ({Hilgers 1969}, s.v. “titina” or “ubuppa,” p. 80) but it has also been proposed that they were used for the filling of oil lamps ({McFadden 1946}, p. 475, no. 32; {Isings 1957}, p. 118) or some sort of a drip feeder for medicinal liquids ({Welker 1974}, pp. 95–98). The more likely hypothesis seems to be that they were used for filling oil lamps, especially clay lamps: their very small filling holes would seem to necessitate the use of a funnel or a spout. However, the obvious discrepancy between the large number of lamps found in excavations and the small number of glass “lamp fillers” does not support this hypothesis unreservedly ({Antonaras 2017}, pp. 102–103). For parallels of baby feeders (guti) see ({Vessberg 1952}, pp. 148–149, gutus type, plates X:1–2, XX:4–5; {Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 47, type XXIII:2; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 165, nos. 234–235; {Antonaras 2009}, form 53a = {Antonaras 2017}, p. 102).

## Description

Cylindrical neck; bird-shaped body. The pressing marks of the pucellas used to shape the vessel are visible on the tip of the tail. Originally blown as a globular flask, which was manipulated while still hot and malleable to produce the desired shape.

## Comments and Comparanda

Very similar to baby-feeders (guti) (see [2003.381](#num)), except for the sealed end in this flask type. This is a small and simplified version—with its simple, pinched bottom—of a relatively well-known form of askos (a wineskin in ancient Greek, i.e., a container of wine made of animal skin) (see comments on [2003.383](#num)). Several parallels for this particular form of flask with trefoil rim are known ({Froehner 1903}, no. 813, p. 117, plate 128.1 \[now MMA 17.194.134: <https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/249378>\]; {Dusenbery 1971}, p. 17, no. 19; {Canav 1985}, p. 39, no. 24; {3000 Jahre Glaskunst}, no. 203; {Whitehouse 2001a}, pp. 121–122, nos. 188–189).

## Description

Flaring, fire-polished rim; wide neck widening toward the conical body; conical, pushed-in base; concave bottom. Strap handle applied on the rim, forming triangular projections, pulled out, down to the shoulder; a small thread was pulled back up toward the rim, forming a central rib. On the body, s-shaped whitish striations are visible, probably signs of the rotation of the vase during the blowing procedure. On the bottom an annular pontil mark (W. 3 cm). The entire vessel is a bit off-center, leaning forward.

## Comments and Comparanda

Jugs with wide neck are known from the first century CE, although they differ in the shape of the handle ({Isings 1957}, pp. 71–72, form 54). Among glass vessels, jug 2003.476 is quite unique in its shape. A similar, dark blue jug has been published from Pompeii ({Scatozza Höricht 2012}, p. 93, no. 6837, plate II, fig. 6). The shape derives from metal prototypes known among finds from Pompeii ({Painter 2001}, p. 65, plate 18, fig. 2, jug M20, wherein relevant metal parallels). Vessels made of the same glass in the JPGM collection are the alabastron [2004.22](#num) and the patella [2003.234](#num), also dated in the early first century CE.

Ground rim; flaring mouth; ovular body, standing on a conical base. The surface is decorated with wheel-cut, lozenge-shaped facets. At the upper part of the mouth are two fine horizontal incisions, and a relief rib delineates the transition to the body, which bears faceted decoration comprising five rows of elongated, lozenge-shaped facets, forming a very regular and tight faceted pattern. The top and bottom rows have rounded upper and lower end, respectively. Below this is a horizontal relief rib. A raised disk (W. 0.7 cm) at the center of the bottom. A small, strap handle was applied on the middle of the body and drawn up to the upper part. The handle has wheel-cut decoration as well, namely, two parallel, vertical strokes along its height, flanked by three perpendicular to it, two on the upper part and one on the lower.

## Comments and Comparanda

The vessel is made of decolorized glass, which was much more valuable and expensive than ordinary greenish glass. In Roman times glass decolorized with manganese or antimony appears from the last third of the first century CE until the beginning of the fourth century CE, but it was most in fashion and had its highest distribution levels from the second quarter of the second to the mid-third century. It was used mainly in western Europe and mostly for tableware although bottles and unguentaria appear among them as well ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 1, pp. xiii–xvii; {Stern 2020}, pp. 769–774).

This jug belongs to a group of possibly molded, probably blown and polished vessels—comprising conical and ovoid beakers, bowls, jars, jugs, and spoons—that are all made of thick decolorized glass ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 1, pp. 13–14). The technique of facet-cutting on glass was invented in Italy in the late 60s or early 70s, when transparent colorless glass became fashionable, and that was due to the fact that facets are best visible on transparent glass and thus the result was much appreciated. Facet-cutting was applied with great success on a wide variety of forms made of decolorized glass ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 1, pp. 343–344). This jug is unique, although it is extremely close to the beakers like [96.AF.320](#num) dated to the late first–early second century CE; all published parallels are found in the western and northern provinces of the Roman Empire ({Foy et al. 2018}, vol. 1, pp. 26–27, form IN 18). Other vessels quite similar in shape include one found in Begram, Afghanistan ({Hamelin 1953}, plate VIII, type b) and one from Szombathely, Hungary ({Barkóczi 1988}, p. 171, no. 402, plate XXXVI, XCIV). In addition, faceted jugs are also known in blue glass ({Whitehouse 1997a}, pp. 235–236, no. 399; {Delacour 1993}, pp. 60–62).

## Description

Fire-polished rim; conical mouth; cylindrical neck, wider toward the sloping shoulder that leads to the everted conical body; slightly concave bottom. The vessel stands on an applied ring-base made of a thick coil of white glass. Thick, white coil is wound under the rim and a fine thread is wound four times at the transition to the shoulder. A fine, coil handle made of white glass with bluish striation in it is applied on the shoulder and ends on the coil under the rim.

## Comparanda

The shape of the vessel, as well as the applied base and the decorative thread around the neck, are very well-known among jugs dated in the third–fourth centuries CE ({Isings 1957}, p. 152, form 121a; {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 125–126, forms 88, 90–92,, wherein several parallels are cited). Nevertheless, this small jug shares the colors of several first-century translucent dark blue vessels with opaque white handles, bases, or purely decorative threads and coils, such as kantharos [84.AF.30](#num), trefoil flask [2003.373](#num), flasks [2003.415](#num), [2003.418](#num), and amphoriskos [2003.368](#num) ({Stern 2001}, p. 70, no. 13; {Antonaras 2017}, p. 138, form 112, no. 460, where other parallels are cited).

## Comparanda

This vessel appears to be quite rare, and the only parallel identical in colors and shape is kept at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh ({Oliver 1980}, p. 51, no. 36). In general for the shape of the vessel, cf. jugs {Isings 1957}, form 88b; {Vessberg 1956}, p.147, form I.3, β.3.γ, fig. 46:13. Additionally, it can be noted that during the first century CE the use of opaque white glass on translucent blue vessels to form handles and bases or in the shape of purely decorative threads and coils is well represented in the JPGM collection, e.g., kantharos [84.AF.30](#num), jug [2003.377](#num), flasks [2003.415](#num), [2003.418](#num), amphoriskos [2003.368](#num).

A fine strap handle has been applied on the shoulder and drawn up, stretching beyond the rim and bent in an acute angle to meet the upper surface of the rim, where it is bent once more at a right angle, ending into a small thumb rest.

## Comments and Comparanda

There are opaque red striations on the body and the handle, indicating that red glass was used in the same workshop either to decorate transparent vessels or even to form entire vessels. This jug is made of dark green glass, known mainly from finds dated in the fourth century CE. For a close parallel see {Antonaras 2012}, p. 172, no. 248. Also, compare jugs at {Israeli 2003}, p. 175, no. 194; {Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 380, no. 1013. In addition, handleless flasks with the same characteristic body have been ascribed to the Syro-Palestinian region, dated in the third–fourth centuries CE.

## Comments and Comparanda

This jug is a characteristic example of Syro-Palestinian glass production in the late fourth century CE. It is very close to the mold-blown jug [2003.427](#num). This group, known as the Blue Zigzag Group, includes several similar vessels—jugs, jars, and spouted flasks—that are made of the same greenish glass, and they are decorated with threads of turquoise glass spirally wound or in zigzags ({Stern 1977}, pp. 120–122). Several examples are published.

Fire-polished rim; trefoil mouth; cylindrical neck; globular body decorated at maximum diameter with five indentations; concave bottom. At the center of the bottom an annular pontil mark (W. 1.6 cm) is visible. A fine thread is spirally wound five times around the mouth. A fine coil handle is applied on the shoulder and terminates, folded, under the rim. A coil was wound twice around the lower neck; now only the wide wad of glass where it was applied on the vessel is preserved, along with a trace of the rest of its path.

## Comparanda

Jugs with same body shape are known from Syro-Palestinian sites, usually with smooth body and plain rim ({Filarska 1952}, p. 153, no. 148, plate 33; {Weinberg 1988}, pp. 66–67, nos. 207–214; {Crowfoot 1957}, p. 416, fig. 96:9; {Matheson 1980}, p. 89, no. 241; {Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 183, nos. 726–727) or rarely with trefoil mouth ({Auth 1976}, p. 208, no. 386), dated in the fourth or fifth century CE.

The indentation around the body is not noted among the parallels cited above. Glassworkers aimed to imitate hammered silver vessels, which were often decorated with smaller or bigger indentations from the first century CE, and during the fourth century it became very popular for Syro-Palestinian products, mostly on small unguentaria, whose bodies were rendered practically square by these indentations ({Antonaras 2017}, pp. 159–160, form 141, nos. 668–680, plate 41), and jars ({Antonaras 2012}, pp. 195–196, nos. 282–285).
