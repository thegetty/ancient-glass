## Condition

Mended; neck, foot, and handles modern additions. There is a small amount of discoloration in this area. There are a few minor nicks and scratches.

## Description

Amphoriskos \[Neck and rim are not preserved. Preserved examples indicate it probably had a horizontal rim with an almost pointed edge and funnel-shaped neck.\]: obtuse-angled junction with rounded shoulder; inverted piriform body; convex bottom; tall, outward-splayed medium blue foot, concave on its underside with a rounded edge. On the shoulder traces of four dark blue handles, probably originally vertical loop handles, are preserved.

Marvered white, turquoise, and yellow threads spirally wound around the body from shoulders to almost the bottom eight times and dragged 19 times upwards, forming a festoon pattern.

Based on its shape ([[Nolte 1968]], p. 165 amphoriskoi, form III.f, wherein several parallels are cited) and decoration, this vessel belongs among the products of a workshop, known in bibliography as “Workshop 2,” which was established early in the reign of Amenhotep III at Malkata and continued its operation during Amenhotep IV in Amarna ([[Nolte 1968]], workshop 2a, pp. 88–93). The vessels of this group are characterized by their garlands, and they can be subdivided into groups 2a and 2b. Our vessel belongs to group 2a, where the garland thread is usually thin and even, drawn out with small arches and very curved; the second group shows irregular garlands, sometimes narrower, sometimes wider, and often curved in large arches. Usually the decoration comprises yellow, white, and light blue threads on an opaque dark blue to translucent copper blue background, just like 2003.146 and [2004.2](#cat). The vessels of the first group are elegant, elongated, and slender, and those of the second group are broader and more compact.

A turquoise or translucent gray unmarvered thread around the rim. The dark-colored body is decorated with splashes of turquoise and yellow glass.

## Comments and Comparanda

No direct parallels are published. The vessel could be a flask ([[Nolte 1968]], form I), although it cannot be excluded that it originally had handles ([[Nolte 1968]], form II). Probably connected to the production of a workshop active after the Amarna period in an unknown place, during the Ramesside period (Nineteenth–Twentieth Dynasties; thirteenth–eleventh centuries BCE), where single-colored vessels were made alongside thread-decorated vases of workgroup 5 ([[Nolte 1968]], pp. 127–129, workshop 6).

## Description

Dark blue ground, opaque white, yellow, and turquoise décor. Flattened, horizontal rim with rounded edge; wide, cylindrical neck, slightly tapering toward the body; almost horizontal rounded shoulder; squat, bulbous body; tall, conical footed base with rounded edge. On the upper body, right below the shoulder, three dark blue loop handles are arranged at equal distances.

A marvered turquoise thread is wound around the rim. Around the neck and on the lower part of the body three marvered threads, opaque white, yellow, and turquoise, are spirally wound and dragged upward, forming a festooned pattern. A marvered turquoise thread encircles the base.

## Comments and Comparanda

Krateriskoi are one of the most characteristic Egyptian vessel forms. This particular shape and the presence of handles date it to the reigns of Tuthmosis III to Amenhotep IV, ca. 1397–to 1350 BCE ([[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 130–131). Furthermore, the turquoise thread around the rim ascribes it to a particular workshop that specialized in decoration of festoon patterns, among which this feature exclusively appears ([[Nolte 1968]], workshop 2a, plate VII:12; [[Nolte 1985]], p. 95, plate 7.9, 12). For a discussion of this workshop, known as “Workshop 2” see [2003.146](#cat).

Comparanda include finds kept in the Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg, the Hermitage St. Petersburg, the Museum of Cairo, and the Louvre ([[Nolte 1968]], workshop 2a, p. 93, no. 12, plate VIII:14, 16, 17, 19); Württembergisches Museum Stuttgart ([[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 130–131, no. 5); Toledo Museum of Art ([[Grose 1989]], pp. 60–61, nos. 7–8) and a similar vessel is in the British Museum ([[Tatton-Brown and Andrews 1991]], pp. 30–31, fig. 26).

## Condition

Mended; parts of the thread on the rim are missing. Reddish remains of the core in the interior.

## Description

Dark blue ground, opaque yellow and green decoration. A flattened coil forms a rudimentary uneven rim-disk; cylindrical neck, tapering toward the body; lentoid body. Two green loop handles extend from lower neck to the shoulder.

An unmarvered yellow thread is wound around the rim. One yellow and one green marvered threads are spirally wound 4 times around the body and dragged up and down 12 times to form a loosely rendered feathered pattern.

## Comments and Comparanda

The translucent, bright copper-blue base color is typical of the Ramesside period (Nineteenth–Twentieth Dynasties; 1292–1070), as is the large green and yellow feather decor of the body. Numerous fragments from the glass workshop in Lisht of thick-walled, squat vessels confirm the dating ([[Nolte 1968]], workshop 5, pp. 121–126, form VII, pp. 172–173, wherein several parallels are cited). The vessel is one of the last thread-decorated glasses in Egypt of excellent quality. Cf. [[Nolte 1968]], p. 121, plate XXI:11, similar feather decoration in yellow and white; XXI:22, a small vessel of a similar shape with yellow and green thread decoration and greenish handles. Also cf.

## Condition

Partly preserved; restored; many cracks are clearly visible, and there are some areas of fill. The surface has some nicks and scratches.

## Description

Ground dark blue, and white in the area of the belly, with yellow thread decoration. Fish-shaped container.

An unmarvered yellow thread is wound around the open mouth and another is applied along the top of the back. The eyes are outlined with a yellow thread. There are two small white projections on the underside, indicating fish’s ventral fins. A flush, vertical yellow thread divides the head from the body and a parallel thread is preserved at the middle of the body; a third yellow thread forms large zigzags between them. On the upper part of the body there are small cavities, which are filled with a translucent yellow substance, possibly glass.

## Comments and Comparanda

The vessel belongs to a well-known form of fish-shaped flasks that represent a [Tilapia nilotica]{.underline} fish, common in the Nile and a standard decorative motif in ancient Egyptian art rendered in many media ([[Shaw and Nicholson 1995]], p. 100). These flasks seem to have held ointments, and since they cannot stand by themselves, they must have been supported by stands. Published examples have been unearthed in Malkata and Amarna (cf. [[Nolte 1968]], pp. 70, 134–136, 176, form XI, plates XXVIII:59, 60; XXIX:1, 2). Other fish-shaped, core-formed Egyptian vessels are known from museum collections: a very colorful example in the British Museum EA55193: <https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA55193> ([[Nolte 1968]], p. 70, plate XXIX:2; [[Cooney 1976]], p. 146, no. 1753, plate VII) and a monochrome one, EA63786: <https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/Y_EA63786> ([[Cooney 1976]], p. 146, no. 1754; [[Tait 1991]], p. 28, fig. 23); a single-colored fish in the Brooklyn Museum, 37.316E (<https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/4014>); also, a similar fish-shaped glass object, probably used as a palette, of the same period is in Miho Museum ([[Miho Museum 2001]], p. 29, 192, no. 21).

## Condition

Intact. Pitting and weathering on the inside have caused a brown discoloration. Pitting on the exterior forms an almost continuous layer of tiny pits. A horizontal crack is visible in the lower body area.

## Description

Flaring rim, with one ground band clearly visible at the tip and another in the interior at the transition to the neck; short, wide, cylindrical neck; rudimentary sloping shoulder; elongated ovoid body; mildly convex bottom. On upper body two opposing oval lugs (knobs). Barely visible, but each lug was first formed as a lozenge that was further cut off or smoothed into its final oval shape.

## Comments and Comparanda

These cast alabastra are part of a Phoenician or Assyrian monochrome glass production that included bowls but also handled jars, jugs, and incense burners. They have been found in Assyria, Cyprus, Italy, and Spain in contexts dated to the late eighth through sixth centuries BCE ([[von Saldern 1970]], pp. 225–228, nos. 48–54; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 75–76). In general, it is believed that they were made by Phoenician craftsmen working in the Assyrian royal court. Particularly for the alabastra, it has been assumed that they were made in Phoenicia ([[Barag 1985]], esp. pp. 52–57). Alabastra appear in two variants: a taller and slender one with height ranging between 18 and 23 cm (from Italy: [[von Saldern 1970]], no. 48 = [[Goldstein 1979]], p. 102, no. 200; [[von Saldern 1970]], no. 51 = [[Barag 1985]], pp. 67–68, no. 44; [[von Saldern 1970]], no. 54a; and Cyprus: [[von Saldern 1970]], no. 52= [[Lightfoot 2017]], p. 29, no. 3), and a squatter one, like 2004.16, with a height between 10 and 14 cm ([[von Saldern 1970]], nos. 50, 53 from Cyprus; [[Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2000]], pp. 166–167, no. 195 from Italy). In addition, a similar squat alabastron has been unearthed in Rhodes in a burial dated to the last quarter of the fourth century BCE ([[Triantafyllidis 2000]], pp. 154–155, no. 15).

## Condition

Condition is good, but the orange glass is fragmented. There are a few minor nicks, fills, and scratches.

## Description

Upright, rounded rim and short, cylindrical greenish-turquoise neck; right-angled junction with vestigial shoulder; elongated body, square in cross-section, tapering downward; almost flat bottom rounded at the periphery. The interior is cylindrical, and the bottom is ca. 1 cm thick.

On the rim is a twisted blue and white thread. On the body two orange threads flush with the surface are spirally wound, and dragged upward at two points on each side, forming festoons. The one on the upper part of the body is wound spirally six times, and the one on the lower part is wound four times. Three opaque white threads are wound horizontally and are flush with the surface. One is on the shoulder, over the orange thread, and two more at the middle of the body, in the void band between the orange threads. Two twisted blue and white threads were applied along the corner edge of each side. Each thread starts on the shoulder of one edge, continues along it, curves at the bottom, and continues along the second edge to the shoulder. A white blob is added on each shoulder that is left protruding toward the neck.

## Comments and Comparanda

These small, tubular vases—assumed to have been used to hold kohl, an eyeliner of antiquity—are known as kohl tubes. They were rod-formed, that is, made by collecting molten glass on one end of a metal rod, which was pulled out after the vessel was formed and decorated, and while it was still hot. Usually made of dark-colored glass decorated with bright-colored threads dragged to form zigzag or feathered patterns, or rarely festoons like 2003.160. Depending on the shape of their body, they are classified into three groups: I. square; II. cylindrical; and III. flattened pear–shaped, and then subdivided into subgroups in relation to their decoration. So, 2003.160 belongs to a rare group of tubes with square cross-section and additional knobs on the corners of the shoulders (group IC). The other two examples in the JPGM collection belong to a homogeneous, relatively numerous group of circular kohl tubes. The first subgroup (group IIC; e.g., [2003.162](#num)) is distinguished by their convex base and the thread decoration, composed of threads of one or two colors, like [2003.162](#num) marvered into the surface and dragged to form festoons. Another subgroup of cylindrical tubes (group IIB) in the JPGM collection are decorated with spirally wound coil decoration, in this case of the same color as the body and dragged up and down, forming a feather pattern ([2003.163](#num)).

They are considered Iranian products, because that is where most of them were unearthed, although occasionally they found their way to distant regions such as Assyria, Georgia, and even Cyprus. They are dated in the fifth and fourth centuries and mainly to the fifth century BCE ([[Barag 1975]]).

An unmarvered purple thread around the rim. A marvered purple thread is wound spirally around the upper half of the body, dragged upward to form a zigzag pattern. Below this a partly marvered thread is wound spirally three times.

## Comments and Comparanda

The alabastron (a narrow-necked flask) was one of the ceramic vessel form that was rendered in glass by the core-forming technique from the sixth century BCE, when this technique, known in Mesopotamia and Egypt since the middle of the second millennium BCE, was introduced in the Aegean world. In addition to alabastra, amphoriskoi (small amphoras), aryballoi, and oinochoiskai (juglets) were also rendered in core-formed glass. It is believed that they functioned as unguentaria, intended for aromatic and cosmetic substances ([[Harden 1981]]; [[McClellan 1984]]; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 109–125; [[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 37–44).

This alabastron belongs to the earliest group of Aegean core-formed vessels, dating from the middle of the sixth century to the end of the fifth century BCE ([[Harden 1981]], pp. 58–99; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 110–115). They were made either of blue glass and decorated with white, yellow, and turquoise threads or of milky white glass decorated with purple threads. Vessels of this group have been found in great numbers in Rhodes, Macedonia, the Aegean islands, and Italy. For the classification of this particular alabastron see [[Grose 1989]], class I:A, alabastron form I:2: pp. 133–134, nos. 65–68.

## Description

Horizontal rim-disk; short, cylindrical neck; rudimentary shoulder; cylindrical body, curving in toward the almost flat, slightly convex bottom. On the shoulder, two opposing, unevenly placed dark blue ring handles with knobbed tails.

One unmarvered turquoise thread is wound around the rim. A marvered turquoise thread is spirally wound 27 times from neck to bottom. It is almost entirely weathered, now appearing white. The first six coils, covering the upper third of the body, are straight and the 18 lower, which cover the lower two-thirds of the body, are dragged up and down, forming a zigzag pattern.

A bronze, m-shaped pin, missing one leg, is placed inside it. This type of double pin appears in the seventh century BCE, probably originating from Macedonia but widespread throughout the Balkans, and continues to appear until the Hellenistic era (fourth–first centuries BCE) mildly altered. For parallels see [[Michailidou-Despotidou 2011]], pp. 92–94, 536, plate 44: 296–297; [[Vasić 1982]], pp. 244–247, fig. 2.

Cobalt blue ground, opaque yellow, turquoise, and white decoration. Broad, horizontal rim-disk, slightly sloping to the outside; cylindrical neck, tapering upward; rudimentary shoulder and cylindrical body, slightly tapering toward the shoulder; shallow, convex bottom. Below the shoulder are two opposing ring handles with long straight tails; neither handle is pierced.

A yellow unmarvered thread around the rim. The body of the vessel, from the shoulder down, is decorated with spirally wound groups of opaque yellow, white, and turquoise threads; yellow appearing four times, and white and turquoise three times. In total more than 50 lines of colored glass are discernible from bottom to the rim. The threads are dragged 16 times upward and downward, forming a delicate feather pattern.

## Comparanda and Comment

On the origins of core-formed alabastra and early examples, see comments on [2003.180](#cat). This object belongs to the second group of core-formed vessels, which appears after the early fourth century BCE and continues to be made until the third century BCE ([[Harden 1981]], pp. 100–121; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 115–122). They were probably produced in more workshops and are found predominantly in mainland Greece, as well as in central and southern Italy. Initially the vessel types of the first group are repeated, differing only in shape and decoration, but later on new shapes appear, like the hydriske, the unguentarium, and the lentoid aryballos. For the classification of this particular alabastron see [[Grose 1989]], class II:A, alabastron form II:2: pp. 154–155, nos. 127–128.

inscription: No

shape: Alabastra

## Condition

Almost fully preserved. Mended, especially around the neck. A small hole on one side of the neck. Around the lower part of the neck three small disks of blue glass have been pushed into the mass of the vase, reinforcing the join between the neck and the body, where large air bubbles are visible in X-ray images, as well as around the bottom. There is an oval depression next to one of the lugs, probably the scar of an unsuccessful attempt to attach a lug there.

## Description

Broad, horizontal disk-shaped rim; wide, cylindrical neck; rudimentary shoulder; cylindrical body; flat bottom. Two opposing horizontal lugs below the shoulder.

A thick, white, unmarvered thread around the rim. This thread has a very thin yellow layer on the side attached to the rim and in one part there are some remains of a dark blue thread. On the upper part of the body a yellowish-white thread—like the one around the rim—and a white thread are each wound once. Below these a white and a yellow marvered thread spirally wound 17 times to the bottom and dragged 18 times upward and downward, forming a zigzag pattern. It is quite probable that all threads consist of a white and a yellow layer, which, depending on the way it was applied on the vessel, appear either white or yellow.

## Comments and Comparanda

On core-formed alabastra of this period see comments on [2003.193](#cat). For the classification of this particular alabastron see [[Grose 1989]], class III:A or B, alabastron form III:1. This example does not fit exactly in either group A or B. Although the thread around the rim is unmarvered, the neck and the upper body are not decorated, the long neck, the cylindrical body, the handles in form of lugs, and their position near the shoulder lead us to ascribe it to this form. For a comparable find from Macedonia cf. [[Adam-Veleni and Ignatiadou 2010]], pp. 336–337, nos. 345–346, dated to the last quarter of the fourth century BCE.

## Description

Horizontal, broad, rim-disk; short, cylindrical neck wider toward the body; cylindrical body wider toward the flat bottom. A thick coil was attached to the shoulder and wound to form the neck. Another coil was attached to the upper side of the neck, wound twice and tooled to form the rim. Two opposing lugs were placed on the upper body near the shoulder; one is missing.

An unmarvered yellow thread is wound around the rim. A marvered yellow thread is wound spirally 28 times from neck to bottom and dragged upward at 16 points, forming a wide feather pattern. The decoration was probably originally composed of two threads, each wound 14 times; the second thread, likely in a different color, is not preserved at all and only the groove of its path remains visible.

A yellow unmarvered thread around the rim. A white marvered thread is spirally wound from bottom to the rim 25 times and dragged 10 times upward and downward, forming a feather pattern.

## Comments and Comparanda

On core-formed alabastra of this period see comments on [2003.193](#cat). No exact parallels have been located. The rim is part of the same mass and not an added-on disk-rim. The handles do not look like the usual ones for form I:3A, and they are made of translucent, bubbly glass. The body fits well with second–first-century BCE products, while the handles seem to imitate duck-shaped handles of the fourth century.

It is not easy to date this vase precisely; it was difficult for the authors of the 1974 catalogue of the Oppenländer Collection to assign to a narrow date, and rather they dated it more vaguely between the fourth and the first century BCE.

Chemical analyses conducted by the GCI scientist Dr. Monica Ganio have shown that the glass of the body does not correspond to other core-formed vessels and it is very rich in zinc, providing another indication that it may have been made in Europe in the nineteenth or twentieth century CE.

## Comments and Comparanda

For a discussion of early core-formed alabastra, see [2003.180](#cat). This object belongs to the third group of core-formed vessels, which appears between the second century BCE and the early first century CE; the centers of production seem to have been in Cyprus and on the Phoenician coast. It includes different shapes of alabastra and amphoriskoi, which are similar to those of ceramic vessels manufactured at the same time ([[Harden 1981]], pp. 123–141; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 122–125). For the classification of this particular alabastron compare [[Grose 1989]], class III:E, alabastron form III:4: p. 168, no. 165, which has a much more acute angle turning to the bottom. Cf. [[Fossing 1940]], p. 112, fig. 84, spotted by Axel von Saldern ([[von Saldern 1974]], no. 191), who also notes that this vessel (2003.194) does not have the unusually elongated shape, but is greatly expanded below the middle of the body.

## Comments and Comparanda

On core-formed alabastra of this period see comments on [2003.194](#cat). The alabastron probably belongs to the fashion of archaicizing vases that were imitating archaic prototypes. In this case for the prototype of the shape of the body see a clay alabastron from Kamiros, dated between the 610–550 BCE, kept in the British Museum: <https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/G_1860-0404-49>. The production technique indicates a much later date, and the object is made of the exact same glass as the jug [2003.476](#num) and the patella [2003.234](#num). See also comments of Axel von Saldern corroborating this dating and ascribing it to the early imperial colored glass vessels ([[von Saldern et al. 1974]], p. 112, no. 300).

The majority of the alabastra of this form are better proportioned and quite similar among themselves, quite different to the squatter variant of 2003.198, which is very similar to an example from Amathous, Cyprus ([[Harden 1981]], p. 128, no. 340).

## Comments and Comparanda

The amphoriskos (small amphora) was one of the ceramic vessel forms that was rendered in glass by the core-forming technique from the sixth century BCE onward, when this technique, known in Mesopotamia and Egypt since the middle of the second millennium BCE, was introduced in the Aegean world. In addition to amphoriskoi, alabastra, aryballoi, and oinochoiskai (juglets) were imitated in core-formed glass. It is believed that they functioned as unguentaria, intended for aromatic and cosmetic substances ([[Harden 1981]]; [[McClellan 1984]]; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 109–125; [[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 37–44).

This object belongs to the earliest group of Aegean core-formed vessels, dating from the middle of the sixth century to the end of the fifth century BCE ([[Harden 1981]], pp. 58–99; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 110–115), which were made either of blue glass and decorated with white, yellow, and turquoise threads or of milky white glass decorated with purple threads. Vessels of this group have been found in great numbers in Rhodes, Macedonia, the Aegean islands, and Italy. For the classification of this particular amphoriskos see [[Grose 1989]], class I:A, amphoriskos form I:2; for the class see p. 143, nos. 94–95; for the form see p. 145, no. 101.

Two dark blue vertical strap handles extend from the shoulders to the upper part of the neck under the rim.

An unmarvered opaque yellow thread is wound around the rim. A marvered wide yellow thread starts on the shoulder and spirals four times around the shoulders and the upper body, where an opaque whitish thread (its white color, likely the result of weathering, was originally turquoise) is wound twice and they are both dragged up and down, forming a zigzag pattern. Below this, a yellow marvered thread is wound horizontally twice around the body.

A bronze chain ending with a large ring is attached to one of the handles.

A thick unmarvered opaque white thread is wound around the rim, and another one around the half of the base-knob.

## Comments and Comparanda

On core-formed amphoriskoi of this period see comments on [2003.178](#cat). This is a very rare variant of the core-formed amphoriskoi because of its monochrome body, and no other examples with the exact same colors of dark green (nearly black) and white have been identified. For the classification of this particular amphoriskos see [[Grose 1989]], class I:F, amphoriskos form I:2. The almost spherical base-knob does not appear among group I amphoriskoi, yet the body shape fits within that group. The base-knob appears in group II, similar to II:2, which has a different body form. Other intriguing details are that the rim was made by bending the mass of the body and not by a separate disc. In addition, only a layer of dirt—no larger particles of the core—is visible in the interior, raising doubts about the production technique and the date of the vessel.

## Description

Dark blue ground with white and yellow décor. Flat, horizontal rim; cylindrical neck; oval body; pointed bottom on a tall, conical, outward-splayed base. On the shoulders are two dark blue horizontal loop handles.

A marvered white thread spirally wound four times on the lower part of the neck continues with eight revolutions on the upper part of the body, where it is flanked by five coils of a yellow thread, and ends with five more coils on the lower body. The decoration on the upper body is dragged upward, forming a zigzag pattern. This tooling resulted in vertical ribbing on the body.

## Comments and Comparanda

Double-handled unguentaria along with hydriskai, jars, and lentoid aryballoi are a new vessel form, ascribed to the second, far rarer group II of Mediterranean core-formed vessels. This group appears late in the fourth century BCE, at the very beginning of the Hellenistic era (fourth–first centuries BCE), and dominated the market until the first or second quarter of the third century. New production centers operated then, probably in Italy and mainland Greece, possibly Macedonia. New decorative patterns replaced the old zigzags with festoons and feather patterns ([[Harden 1981]], pp. 100–121; [[McClellan 1984]], pp. 77–126; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 115–122; [[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 38–39).

Two opposing vertical greenish strap handles extend from the shoulder to just below the rim, bend, and then attach on the middle of the neck.

A marvered opaque yellow thread is wound on the rim and spirals to the bottom twenty-two times, in horizontal lines to the shoulder, tooled to form a carelessly executed feathered pattern on the body and finally in straight-lined spiral on the bottom near the base-knob.

## Comments and Comparanda

Amphoriskoi are one of the two main vessel forms produced in glass workshops active in the eastern Mediterranean between the middle of the second century BCE and the early first century CE, conventionally referred to as Mediterranean group III, a period of revival of core-forming, after a century-long period of stasis during which no new glass vessel forms were introduced. On Mediterranean group II: [[Harden 1981]], pp. 123–141; [[McClellan 1984]], pp. 127–164; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 122–125; [[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], p. 39.

culture: Greek

material: Dark blue; opaque yellow and white glass

modeling_technique_and_decoration: Core-formed; applied rim-disk and marvered threads

inscription: No

shape: Amphoriskoi

technique: Core-formed

## Condition

Mended. Part of the rim and several parts of the body and the bottom are fills. Some cracks are visible; surface pitted and in areas discolored. Probably missing handles and base pad. There is a visible scar where the lower part of a now-missing handle once attached. The corresponding handle attachment spot of the rim is missing. Spots on the shoulder and rim where the other handle, now missing, would have been attached are filled with a colored resin.

## Description

Broad, horizontal rim-disk, long cylindrical neck gradually widening toward the body; obtuse-angled shoulder, long convex lower part of the body. It is highly likely that it had two long S-shaped handles and a pad base, but because critical parts of the rim, shoulder, and bottom areas are missing, it is not possible to determine the exact shape of the vessel.

A yellow and a white marvered threads spirally wound around the vessel from rim to the center of the bottom. The thread was tooled three times downward and three times upward to form very wide feather patterns on the neck and the upper body, and five times downward and five times upward on the lower body.

## Comments and Comparanda

On the origins of core-formed amphoriskoi, see [2003.178](#cat). This object belongs to the third group of core-formed vessels, which appears between the second century BCE and the early first century CE; the centers of production seem to have been in Cyprus and on the Phoenician coast. It includes different shapes of alabastra and amphoriskoi, which are similar to those of ceramic vessels manufactured at the same time ([[Harden 1981]], pp. 123–141; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 122–125). For the classification of this particular alabastron see [[Grose 1989]], p. 123, class III:E, amphoriskos form III:3. A few unprovenanced examples include [[Grose 1989]], pp. 172–173, nos. 177–179; Brooklyn Museum, New York, inv.-nr. 12.34: vessel’s form and displaced feather pattern are the same, and it preserves the strongly curved handles stretching from the rim to the shoulder, typical for the form. That vessel was reassembled with the addition of what seems to be a free-blown base of a stemmed beaker: <https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/5809>; Musée du Verre, Grand Curtius, Liège, inv. no. B 1463; the same vessel without handle and with a flat foot noted in [[von Saldern 1974]], no. 206; [[Hayes 1975]], p. 15, no. 38, plate 3: [https://collections.rom.on.ca/objects/405071/](https://collections.rom.on.ca/objects/405071/amphoriskos-with-sshaped-handles?ctx=d39e1c4c-60b3-4e2b-b0ad-1e27d908798b&idx=5).

Mild pitting. A burst bubble on the lower part of the handle.

## Description:

Core-formed, opaque white oinochoe decorated with translucent purple threads. Trefoil rim-disk; short, cylindrical neck; sloping shoulder; ovoid body; convex bottom; discoid conical base. Tall, strap handle, arching well above the rim-disk, applied on the shoulder and attached on the rim.

One unmarvered thread around the rim and the base. A marvered thread is wound eight times from neck to mid-body. The last four coils, on the wider part of the body, are dragged up and down, forming a zigzag pattern, the last three coils are adjacent, appearing as one wide thread. Just below the zigzag pattern, another purple thread is wound twice around.

## Comments and Comparanda

The oinochoiske (juglet) was one of the ceramic vessel forms that had been rendered in glass with core-forming since the sixth century BCE, when this technique, known in Mesopotamia and Egypt since the middle of the second millennium BCE, was introduced in the Aegean world. In addition to oinochoiskai, amphoriskoi (small amphoras), alabastra, and aryballoi were imitated in core-formed glass. It is believed that they functioned as unguentaria, intended for aromatic and cosmetic substances ([[Harden 1981]]; [[McClellan 1984]]; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 109–125; [[Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994]], pp. 37–44).

This object belongs to the earliest group of Aegean core-formed vessels, dating from the middle of the sixth century to the end of the fifth century BCE ([[Harden 1981]], pp. 58–99; [[Grose 1989]], pp. 110–115), which were made either of blue glass and decorated with white, yellow, and turquoise threads or of milky white glass decorated with purple threads. Vessels of this group have been found in great numbers in Rhodes, Macedonia, the Aegean islands, and Italy. For the classification of this particular oinochoe see [[Grose 1989]], class I:A, oinochoe form I:2: pp. 148–149, nos. 110–113.

## Condition

Fully preserved; mended. There is some discoloration; minor nicks and scratches on the surface.

## Description

Dark-blue ground with opaque yellow, white, and turquoise threads. Broad trefoil rim-disk; cylindrical neck, tapering toward the body; rounded sloping shoulder; straight-sided, almost cylindrical body tapering toward the bottom; circular cobalt blue pad base, asymmetrical uneven and slightly concave on its underside. A vertical cobalt-blue strap handle applied on the shoulder and, arching, extends to the edge of the rim-disk.

An unmarvered thread is wound around the rim and another is wound spirally three times around the neck. Seven threads are wound spirally around the body. Each one continues and intermingles with the other. A yellow thread starts on the shoulder and spirals four times, followed by a turquoise and a white thread, each spiraling three times. At the middle of the body the same sequence is repeated, and the decoration closes with a yellow thread spiraled four times near the bottom of the vessel. All these threads are dragged up and down 24 times, forming a feather pattern, and some of the finer strands are not visible in every column.

One unmarvered yellow thread is wound around the base.
