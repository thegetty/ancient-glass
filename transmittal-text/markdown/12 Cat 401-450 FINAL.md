## Comparanda

This is a very simple form of utilitarian vessel that was produced at many sites in the Islamic world essentially unaltered, since its shape was suitable for meeting everyday needs without any particular modifications. A similar vessel was found in Fustat, Egypt ({Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001}, p. 31, form 10a), and Nishapur, Iran ({Kröger 1995}, pp. 72–73, nos. 90–92); another is in the Newark Museum ({Auth 1976}, p. 164, no. 220). Cf. also {von Saldern 1974}, p. 221, no. 336 for a parallel decorated with an applied thread.

## Comparanda

This vessel belongs to a group of thick-walled glass flasks that have been identified with “grenades.” Ceramic “grenades” of the same shape and size, sometimes with molded decoration, are well known in the Islamic word ({Ettinghausen 1965}, pp. 218–229), for which it has been assumed that they were either actual grenades, or that they were used for the transportation of valuable liquids, or, more plausibly, that they were beer containers ([fuqqāʿa]{.underline} in Arabic) ({Ghouchani and Adle 1992}, pp. 72–92; {Whitehouse 2014}, pp. 92–93, no. 767). For other glass parallels see: {Mostafa 1959}, pp. 89–92; {Ettinghausen 1965}, pp. 218–229; {von Saldern et al. 1974}, p. 255, no. 746; {Maddison and Savage-Smith 1997}, nos. 210, 211; {Carboni 2001}, pp. 212–213, no. 53b; {Valiulina 2005}, p. 48, fig. 21:3; {Whitehouse 2014}, pp. 92–93, no. 767.

## Condition

Small piece of rim missing. Small parts of the body covered with calcination and off-white weathering.

## Description

Very thick, free-blown flask. Out-folded, flattened, horizontal rim; short, cylindrical neck, with a constriction at its base; ribbed, globular body, standing on a very small flat bottom.

Eight heavy ribs start under the neck and continue all the way to the center of the undersurface. Mild notches are noticeable in the places where the pucellas were pressed on the surface and started the pinching that resulted in the formation of the rib. Large chips of opaque white glass were irregularly dispersed throughout the vessel, from neck to undersurface.

## Comparanda

This flask is quite unusual, and no proper parallels were found. The great thickness of the vessel is quite uncommon among blown Roman glassware. Thinner, dark blue jars and flasks with white and yellow chips marvered on their surface are ascribed to the Egyptian region and dated in the sixth–eighth centuries ({Carboni 2001}, pp. 36–37, nos. 1.2a–d).

## Condition

Composed of two different vessels. The rim and neck to the transition to the body is one vessel. The lower end of this part is ground to fit with the crack on the shoulder of the lower vessel. This lower vessel is mended and covered by corrosion and iridescence. The only area where the original cut surface is preserved is on the opposite side of the “handle-lump.”

## Description

Upper part: Fire-polished, flaring rim; long, cylindrical neck, decorated on the upper part with a fine thread, spirally wound five times, and further below that a wavy coil, a fine thread wound once, and a thick, wavy coil that forms three plastic protuberances, one of which is genuine (the other two are modern plaster additions—and one of those is only partly preserved).

Lower part: Globular, bicolor body. The upper part is made of dark blue glass and is smooth. The lower part of the body is made of colorless glass and stands on a pad base. Around the colorless part of the body are five oval, pincered ring-and-dot motifs. At the transition to the blue shoulder part a colorless lump is preserved, probably the base of a handle.

## Comments and Comparanda

The flask was made of two gathers of glass that were blown separately; the lower one was decorated, and then they were joined by fusing. The decoration was formed on the still-hot vessel with one or more tools shaped like pincers or tongs. The jaws of the tool used for this flask bore intaglio decoration, which, when the tongs were applied to the glass and squeezed, produced ornament that is in relief. Most vessels have a single motif repeated several times, and the repertoire includes representations of animals, inscriptions, rosettes, ring-and-dot motifs (like 78.AK.30), and other geometric features. Vessels decorated with pincered motifs are found in a various regions and sites in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran, and China ({Carboni 2001}, pp. 102–103; {Whitehouse 2014}, p. 129; {Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001}, pp. 80–82, type 38a–j; {Kröger 1995}, pp. 95–99, nos. 135–140; {An 1991}, p. 124, fig. 9; {von Saldern 1980}, p. 177, no. 180). Pincered decoration is usually dated to the ninth and tenth centuries.

The piece for the neck belongs to a much more modern vessel, probably dated to the eighteenth or nineteenth century, possibly from Persia or the Arab world (cf. {Goldstein et al. 2005}, pp. 303–307, nos. 324–329).

## Description

Cracked-off rim; short, narrow, cylindrical neck; sloping shoulder; cylindrical body tapering toward the convex bottom. No pontil mark visible on the bottom. On upper body a pinched fold, probably a repair of a tear in the vessel’s thin wall that was pressed shut by the glassblower while he was still forming the hot and malleable material into a vessel.

## Comparanda

This vessel belongs to a well-known form of quite tall and slender flask, always with cracked-off, upright rim and very thin walls, mostly made with dark blue glass, occasionally with one flattened side. They are found in tenth-century contexts, and they may have survived up to the early eleventh century CE. Due to the extremely wide distribution of the finds it has been proposed that they were produced at several sites, but the fact that they are always made of the same dark blue glass, with the same typological characteristics, indicates that they were more probably produced at one site, probably in Egypt, as the large numbers of finds from that region would indicate ({Foy 2020}, pp. 105–106).

The wide array of find sites throughout the Muslim world has recently been collated by Danièle Foy in discussing the finds from Sabra al-Mansuriyya, Tunisia ({Foy 2020}, pp. 105–106, 109–110, nos. 184–190), including the following: Iraq ({Lamm 1928}, p. 27, no. 105); Iran ({Kervran 1984}, fig. 7, no. 19); Nishapur, Iran ({Kröger 1995}, pp. 74–75); Kush ({Worrell and Price 2003}, p. 246, fig. 8); Al-Mabiyat, Hijaz ({Gilmore et al. 1985}, plate 104, no. 33); the coast of Yemen ({Foy 2015b}, pp. 350–351, nos. 183–185). On the East African coast, Manda ({Morrison 1984}, p. 172, fig. 139); Al Mina, Syria ({Lane 1937}, p. 65, fig. 10:C); Fustat, Egypt ({Shindo 1992}, p. 597, nos. 1–19; {Shindo 2000}, fig. 6, no. 9); Tebtunis, Fayum ({Foy 2001}, nos. 118, 146, 151); Sina, Raya ({Shindo 2003}, p. 180); Palestine ({Brosh 2003}, p. 348, no. 459); Caesarea ({Pollak 2003}, fig. 3, no. 45); Tiberias, Israel ({Lester 2003}, fig. 2, no. 18); Ramla ({Gorin-Rosen 2010}, pp. 227–228); Sumatra ({Guillot 2003}, p. 239, no. 14). In addition, several examples are known from museum collections: the Corning Museum of Glass (55.1.12: {Whitehouse 2014}, p. 46, no. 663, allegedly acquired in Lebanon = {[Glass from the Ancient World]{.underline} 1957}, p. 235, no. 461); Kunstpalast Düsseldorf (P. 1973-39: {von Saldern 1974}, p. 243, no. 382); the Newark Museum (50.1823: {Auth 1976}, p. 166, no. 222); L. A.

Fire-polished, flaring rim; conical neck with large bulge under the rim and a smaller one at its base; elongated, conical body, narrowing to a small flat bottom, which is flat, with a pontil scar (W. 0.5 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

Vessels of this shape are known as “spearhead flasks” due the tapering of the body toward the narrow bottom. They were recognized as containers for kohl, a cosmetic substance for the decoration of the eyelids, which was archaeologically attested in different sites in Israel and the Sinai Peninsula ({Brosh 1993}; {Shindo 1993}, pp. 303–304).

Predecessors of the spearlike flasks with pointed body but smooth neck are known and have been dated between the seventh and ninth centuries ({Goldstein et al. 2005}, p. 67, no. 55, pp. 72–73, no. 67). The spearhead flasks have been dated from the eighth to the twelfth centuries. In addition to the numerous undecorated free-blown examples (e.g., {Auth 1976}, p. 231, nos. 534–536, esp. no. 535; {Dzanpoladian and Kalantarian 1988}, p. 24, no. 55, plate XLIII:7; {Arakelian, Tiratzian, and Khachatrian 1969}, p. 64, no. 148; {von Saldern 1974}, p. 243, no. 381; {Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001}, p. 43, forms 18a–d; {Foy 2020}, pp. 68–69 type Sb44; {Goldstein et al. 2005}, p. 222, no. 256; {Whitehouse 2014}, pp. 51–53, nos. 671, 674, 676; {Hadad 2005}, pp. 40–41, 164–165, plate 38:784–786), there are published several examples with marvered decoration ({Lamm 1930}, plate 32:5–7; {Harden 1955}, p. 63, no. 14, fig. 37; {Whitecomb 1983}, p. 102, fig. 2.cc, ee, mm, nn; {Taniichi 1987}, pp. 53, 90, no. 108; {von Saldern 1968}, no. 69, plate 68; {Carboni and Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 139, no. 55; {Carboni 2001}, pp. 304–305, nos. 80a–c; {Goldstein et al. 2005}, p. 261, nos. 300–303) and with spiraling or vertical ribbing ({Carboni 2001}, p. 242, no. 3.29a; {Whitehouse 2014}, pp. 105, 114, no. 805), and with mold-blown motifs ({von Saldern 1968}, p. 94, no. 68; {Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001}, p. 43, form 18e; {Whitehouse 2014}, pp. 105, 107–108, nos. 788, 792).

## Description

Fire-polished rim; conical neck with a constriction at its base; sloping shoulders; six-sided, elongated body; flat bottom. On the bottom an annular pontil scar (W. 1.3, Th. 0.2 cm). A small area at the bottom of two sides is rough and uneven. A marvered, opaque red thread is spirally wound 11 times from the bottom of the vessel to the tip of the rim and dragged upward nine times, forming unequal festoons. Along the upper half of one of the sides is a fold that was formed accidentally.

## Comparanda

This six-sided flask, sloping toward the bottom, is quite similar to the group of flasks called “spearhead flasks” due to the pointed shape of the body; it is believed that they were used as containers for kohl, a cosmetic preparation for decorating the eyelids ({Brosh 1993}, pp. 289–295). On spearhead flasks see comments and comparanda cited in [2003.446](#num), with various parallels dated from the seventh to the twelfth centuries. A four-sided parallel with threads in three colors, which is in the Kuwait National Museum, has been assigned to the Egyptian or Syrian region and is dated in the seventh–eighth century, as are two undecorated flasks of a very similar shape from the same collection dated in the ninth–tenth century ({Carboni 2001}, p. 297, no. 75b and p. 155, nos. 3.7a–b, respectively). Published examples of quite similar pointed flasks with a spirally wound thread in a striking color, but circular in cross section, include: Carnegie Museum of Natural History 25141 ({Oliver 1980}, p. 140, no. 241); Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 18.273 ({von Saldern 1968}, no. 69); Musée Curtius, Liège, BAAR 1482 ({Musée Curtius 1958}, p. 91, no. 196; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 18.273 ({von Saldern 1968}, no. 69); Newark Museum 50.1334 ({Auth 1976}, p. 174, no. 241); formerly the collection of R.

## Comments and Comparanda

Facet-cut, small-size vessels are a well-known form, reflecting the fashion that appreciated cut decoration on various forms of tableware and smaller flasks. They have been attributed to Iranian workshops, since this technique was known in sixth-century Sassanian glassware, although they may have been produced in other regions as well ({Carboni 2001}, p. 131, no. 2.34b; {Brosh 2003}, p. 363, no. 491). Sites yielding finds include Fustat in Egypt ({Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001}, pp. 86–88, form 41, and especially 41c–f, which are elongated examples like 79.AF.184.15, dated in the ninth–tenth century); Sabra al-Mansuriyya, Tunisia ({Foy 2020}, p. 98, type Sb23, fig. 42); a flask in the Israel Museum ({Brosh 2003}, p. 363, no. 495), and two more in the Khalili Collection ({Goldstein et al. 2005}, p. 159, nos. 185–186).

## Condition

Mended; a concealed join at the transition from the neck to the body. Iridescence and pitting on the exterior, whitish incrustation on the interior.

## Description

Fire-polished rim, bent slightly inward; conical neck with five horizontal constrictions; sloping shoulder; everted conical body; slightly concave bottom. Circular mark of a solid pontil (W. 0.6 cm) at the center of the bottom.

On the body incised decoration: On the rounded shoulder on the uppermost part of the body there is a frieze of ovals. Below this frieze is a horizontal groove and another one near the bottom. Between these two grooves, six truncated triangles are arranged all around the body, each one inscribing a dash at the upper part and a semicircular groove at the bottom. Between the triangles there is a semicircular groove hanging from the upper horizontal groove.

## Comparanda

Small flasks with globular or squat, cylindrical body, and neck with consequent constrictions are quite well-known, dated between the late eighth and the eleventh centuries. See comments on [79.AF.184.32](#cat).

Wheel-cutting and wheel-engraving were popular decorative techniques between the ninth and eleventh centuries in Islamic glassware, as numerous finds from various sites in Syria, Palestine, Iraq, Iran, Egypt, and Tunisia prove. Six categories of cut and engraved objects are defined on the basis of the decoration, which can be: scratch-engraved, faceted, with disks and related motifs, with raised outlines, slant-cut, and linear. In the twelfth century, cutting gradually goes out of fashion, being replaced by enameling, which was the technique that prevailed during the next two centuries in Islamic glassware.

Cutting was employed mostly for the embellishment of colorless vessels of various forms, such as bowls, bottles, goblets, and flasks, although colorful and even cameo vessels occur too. There are indications that quite similar products were made in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, and Egypt ({Kröger 1995}, pp. 116–175; {Kröger 1999}, pp. 219–232; {Carboni 2001}, pp. 71–136; {Whitehouse 2001b}, pp. 155–161; {Foy 2020}, pp. 85–98). For miniature flasks with cut decoration, see [2003.472](#cat), with several parallels from various sites.

## Comments and Comparanda

The neck and rim part probably belong to a Roman flask, likely conical with long neck, made in Egypt that can be dated in the late first–second century CE ({Edgar 1905}, plate VIII, no. 32.640; {Harden 1936}, plate XX, no. 797; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 222, no. 347).

The body belongs to an Islamic flask ({Lamm 1930}, plate 3:36; {Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001}, p. 42, form 17e). [79.AF.184.6](#num) has a quite similar body shape.

## Description

Fire-polished, vertical rim; cylindrical neck with six horizontal constrictions on its upper part. Mildly sloping shoulder; short, cylindrical body, curving in at bottom; slightly concave bottom. A circular mark of a solid pontil (W. 0.8 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.

## Comparanda

In general small, plain, undecorated flasks with relatively long neck appear in several variants, with globular, squat, ovoid, and even biconical body, dated between the ninth and eleventh centuries. Sites with relevant finds include Fustat ({Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001}, pp. 38–39, fig. 15-f; {Whitehouse 2014}, pp. 43–44, no. 659); Beit She’an ({Hadad 2005}, pp. 39, 158–159, nos. 691–292); Abu Skhair, Iraq ({Negro Ponzi Mancini 1972}, nos. 3–6); Sabra al-Mansuriyya, Tunisia ({Foy 2020}, pp. 62–65, type Sb1, fig. 27).

Small flasks with globular or squat, cylindrical body, and neck with consequent constrictions are quite well-known, dated between the late eighth and the eleventh centuries. See examples from Fustat, Cairo ({Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001}, p. 47, type 20a–i and in particular 20f, with the same body shape as 79.AF.184.32; {Shindo 1992}, fig. IV-6–14:26–31). Another probably Egyptian flask is in the Corning Museum of Glass ({Whitehouse 2014}, p. 66, no. 714). Numerous parallels from Syro-Palestinian sites, and sites in Egypt, Iraq, Iran, the east African coast, Armenia, and Greece are published, indicating the wide distribution these vessels had: Beit She’an ({Hadad 2005}, pp. 40–41, plate 38, nos. 762–779, wherein exhaustive bibliography); other published sites include Tiberias ({Lester 2004}, p. 185, no. 95), Yoqne’am ({Lester 1996}, p. 204, fig. XVIL4:7), Caesarea ({Pollak 2003}, p. 166, fig. 2:25–26, 28), Nessana ({Harden 1962}, p. 87, nos. 66–69), Manda ({Morrison 1984}, pp. 164–167, fig. 134:j), Seleucia ({Negro Ponzi 1970–71}, pp. 67–71, fig. 50:42), Iran ({Lamm 1935}, p. 9, pIate 28:F), and Corinth ({Davidson 1952}, p. 107, no. 684).

Material: Translucent purple and opaque green glass, heavily weathered

Modeling technique and decoration: Free-blown; applied elements, incised

Inscription: No

Shape: Flasks

## Condition

Fully preserved; heavily weathered.

## Description

Fire-polished, slightly in-turned, vertical rim; wide, cylindrical neck, severely constricted at its base; horizontal shoulder; biconical body with larger and slightly convex upper part and smaller and concave lower part; conical, folded base-ring; concave bottom. At the center of the bottom is the scar (W. 0.8 cm) of a solid pontil. The vessel is slightly lopsided. The tip of the rim is topped with an opaque green trail. On the neck and body from rim to base are incised ca. 22 horizontal bands (0.4 cm wide) comprised of fine incisions, leaving void bands 0.4 cm wide. A zigzag pattern is visible around the bottom of the neck.

## Comments and Comparanda

Probably the zigzag pattern, or rather the small triangles between which the zigzag is now visible, was covered with some substance, such as gold foil, that left the surface under it smooth and unaffected by the corrosion/weathering that has covered the vessel in general. Note the traces of gilding in the incised lines of two of the six deep-blue, ninth-century plates found in the crypt of Famen Temple (Famensi) in Shaanxi Province, China: {An 1991}, pp. 123–124, figs. 3–8; compare {Michaelson 1999}, pp. 158–159, no. 115.

## Condition

Intact. There is a little weathering, mostly on the zigzag thread.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim, constricted at the transition to the squat globular body, standing on a slightly convex bottom. A circular scar of a solid pontil (W. 0.6 × 0.4 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.

The vessel is decorated with a thick coil comprised of marbled red, turquoise, and white threads brought around the body in a zigzag pattern (eight times) and around the rim.

## Comparanda

Similar vessels with thick, unmarvered thread are rare but known: a small bottle made of the same translucent olive-green glass decorated with an opaque red thread dated in the seventh–eighth century, ascribed to a Syrian workshop ({Carboni 2001}, p. 41, no. 1.7b); and a flask that is similar in craftmanship, with applied thick coils, dated fifth–seventh centuries and ascribed to an Islamic workshop ({Musée Curtius 1958}, pp. 97–98, no. 212).

Very similar thick, globular jars with marvered red and white threads are known from various collections, dated between the fifth and eighth centuries, ascribed to Syro-Palestinian workshops ({Oliver 1980}, p. 139, no. 240; {Platz-Horster 1976}, no. 185; {von Saldern et al. 1974}, p. 128, no. 388; {Goldstein et al. 2005}, pp. 42–43, no. 22; {Whitehouse 2001a}, pp. 212–213, nos. 778).

Material: Dark blue, appearing opaque black glass

Modeling technique and decoration: Free-blown

Shape: Jars

Technique: Free-blown

## Condition

Fully preserved. Weathering has caused iridescence on the inside and around the mouth. The bronze wire is weathered, appearing greenish, and the hoop around the neck is broken.

## Description

Flaring, fire-polished, rounded rim; short, funnel mouth; wide, convex shoulder, ending in a horizontal bulge, below which the body gradually tapers toward the flat, slightly concave bottom. A solid relief pontil scar (W. 1 cm) is visible at the center of the bottom.

A twisted bronze wire, wound around the neck, forms a hoop—now an open ring—from which two figure-eight-shaped loops are suspended; the bent ends of the long, horseshoe-shaped handle pass through these two loops. Each loop is made of a ring, pushed in to form two oval eyelets and then folded again, bringing the eyelets next to each other and thus forming a loop.

## Comparanda

Small-sized jars of similar shape and quality are known from excavations at Fustat, the center of medieval Cairo in Egypt ({Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001}, pp. 50–51, type 22b), dated in the ninth–eleventh centuries; also, see a jar at the Corning Museum of Glass ({Whitehouse 2014}, pp. 42–43, nos. 656–658) dated between the ninth and eleventh centuries CE, and another at the Newark Museum ({Auth 1976}, p. 229, no. 518).

## Condition

Fully preserved; reassembled.

## Description

The bowl was created from 36 glass canes, fused together in the following pattern: a composite cane of a blue band is flanked on either side by a rod of colorless glass in which two white rods spiral; this cane is flanked by a yellow band which is in turn flanked by a complex cane comprised of a white band flanked on either side by a rod of colorless-purplish glass in which spiral two white rods. The rim of the bowl forms a spiraled cane of colorless-purplish glass in which are spiraling two white rods.

## Comments and Comparanda

This vessel is a replica of Roman imperial striped mosaic vessels, similar to [2004.26.7](#num) and [2003.258.6](#num). It is a copy very close to the Roman prototypes produced in Venice. Mosaic glass had been attracting more and more attention from rich clientele since the discovery of Pompeii in 1748, and imitations are known from the late eighteenth–early nineteenth centuries. The technique met a great revival in Venice in the second half of the nineteenth century when large companies like those run by Antonio Salviati and Vincenzo Moreti operated there ({Whitehouse 2007}, pp. 36–39). This particular bowl has been tentatively ascribed to the Compagnia di Venezia e Murano (Italian; founded 1866, dissolved 1909) ({Whitehouse 2007}, p. 170, no. 74).

## Description

Disc made of colorless, blue, and gold glass. The circular body is slightly convex. In its center, a standing female figure drawn on gold leaf wears a long tunic and an elaborate headdress. She opens her arms in a gesture of prayer. Gold inscriptions flank her. A wide gold vine with tendrils set between two bands encircles the scene. The rim is heavily chipped. A large fragment was reattached.

At the center of the underside the circular scar of a solid pontil (W. 0.7 cm) is visible.

The glassblower made a small plate of dark blue glass, which was \[\[annealed\]\]; later a gold foil was applied to it, which was cut and incised to form the desired representation. This was reheated and a transparent bubble of glass was blown onto it, which formed the interior bottom and walls of the bowl. In addition, a coil of colorless glass was wound around the disk, forming a coil base for the vessel. The base coil is pressed along its center where a horizontal groove is formed. creating the illusion that it consists of two different coils, the upper thicker and the lower finer.

Inscription: On the left of the figure: BELUCIA / FEDELISSSIMA / VIRCO / IN PACE/ IIIIX / CALENDAS / BENTURAS / SEPTEM/BRES /. On the right of the figure: OVE VIXYT / ANNOS / XVIII.

## Comments and Comparanda

This disk is a replica of well-known late antique vetri d’oro or gold-glass medallions and bowls. (On the ancient gold glass objects see {Pillinger 1984}. For a recent, updated overview of this production and the examples in the rich collection of the British Museum see {Howells 2015}.)

There are several known examples of these replicas, made and sold in Italy during the late nineteenth century that today are part of museum collections. (For a general overview on these objects as a group see {Pillinger 1984}, pp. 15–26; {Whitehouse 2007}, pp. 19–23.) Characteristic examples include those in the British Museum collection ({Howells 2015}, pp. 146–152), the University Art Gallery ({Matheson 1980}, pp. 142–144), and the Corning Museum of Glass ({Whitehouse 1994}, pp. 133–135).

Part of the bottom of a bowl. A gold-glass-trail inscription in two rows divided by a line: INNO/CENTI, set in a rectangular frame with a straight, fine line and a folded exterior one.

## Comments and Comparanda

This is a replica imitating a special group of glass vessels with an inscription in gold placed between two layers of transparent glass, in the gilt-glass-trail technique. On the taste for copies of late Roman gold-glass vessels in the late nineteenth century see comments on [2003.296](#cat). In a rectangular, often colored—for example, blue or red—frame a generic “cheers” phrase was written in two lines, such as ANNI/BONI, etc. They are dated in the second half of the third century CE and are products of a western, probably Italian workshop.

## Condition

Pastiche of two rim fragments.

## Description

This pastiche consists of the rims of two different flasks, which have been conjoined, creating the form of a miniature stemmed beaker.

The body of the beaker comprise the out-folded rim and wide upper neck, part of the neck of a vessel dated probably in the fourth century from Egypt (e.g., {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 105–106, form 58 or 59). The funnel-shaped mouth with in-folded, tubular rim of a flask that has been placed up-side-down and forms the stem of the pastiche. It is probably dated in ca. third–fourth century CE (e.g., {Antonaras 2012}, p. 146, no. 202). The interior of this part is filled with what appears to be a glass lump which forms the flat bottom of the body. It has been painted carefully to the exact same tone of green like the glass fragments are.

The seam between the two fragments is covered with a fine layer of some kind of plaster painted appropriately.

## Condition

Intact; small patches of white weathering.

## Description

In-folded, flaring rim. The lip was in-folded for 1.4 cm and then it was flattened only in the interior leaving the exterior walls convex. The neck is extremely short and wide; the body is ovular and stands on an applied conical base. At the center of the bottom there is a circular excess of colorless glass, remainder of a solid pontil (W. 1 cm) which was used for holding the vessel during the shaping of the rim and the attachment of the handles. There are three coil handles attached on the shoulder and stretched up ending on the tip of the rim forming an almost circular loop.

## Comments and Comparanda

It may be modern. There are too many air bubbles in its mass. The shape and curvature of the handles is unexpected, although the handles are not cut, as a modern glassblower would have done, but rather the end of the coil is stretched and bent on the body of the handle as one would expect it in an ancient product. The extremely elongated fold of glass that has been folded in the interior of the rim is unprecedented among ancient vessels. The truly colorless glass of the solid pontil scar looks also modern, if it was indeed ancient this quality of glass would have been very rare and expensive and it would not be “wasted” on the tip of the pontil for the production of such an average vessel.

## Comments and Comparanda

In ancient Egypt prefabricated, colorful glass inlays were often used as parts of decorative composite reliefs in figural scenes and inscriptions on wooden, ivory, and stone objects such as shrines, statues and statuettes, mummies, mummy masks, coffins, and expensive furniture. The body parts of the kings were rendered mostly in red and those of the gods in blue-greenish glass. These inlays either protruded in relief or were placed in individual cells half- or completely sunken in the surface of the object. They appeared from the Eighteenth Dynasty, during the reign of Amenhotep III (1387–1350 BCE) ({Cooney 1960}, pp. 11–33; {Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994}, p. 143, comments on no. 11).

## Comments and Comparanda

On Pharaonic Egyptian glass inlays in general see comments at [2003.149](#cat).

Frontal depiction of the face is quite rare in Egyptian art, mostly used as a hieroglyph with the sound value [ḥr]{.underline} (meaning “on, around, over, for”). The piece is small and may have been used in an inlaid band of inscriptions in a miniature shrine, or may have been the inlaid face of an ushabti figurine (on glass in statuettes in general see {Cooney 1960}, pp. 21–29, fig. 19).

## Description

Bronze statuette of a squatting Ibis. The head and feet are separately cast in bronze, and the feet have tangs for attachment. The splayed talons are naturalistically cast and incised. The ibis head has a sinuous neck, and a long, down-curved bill with two triple grooves along its length. The eyes are recessed for the insertion of inlay. Of the eye inlays, only the plaster bed that once connected them has survived. The body is a dark, opaque blue and the tail feathers are inlaid opaque red glass with engraved details, perfectly fitted to the blue body.

## Comments and Comparanda

The ibis is a cult symbol and a manifestation of the ancient Egyptian god Thoth, worshiped as the god of the moon, wisdom, writing, magic, art, and knowledge. There are several bronze statuettes of crouching ibis figures with glass or wooden body, especially from the Ptolemaic period, when the custom of making votive statues of sacred animals was extremely popular.

Inlaid eyes were often used in statues and statuettes, mummies, mummy masks, and coffins. It is not only human mummies who had inlayed eyes, but those of animals as well, when they were considered personifications of deities or else connected to deities like the sacred bull Apis ({Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994}, pp. 174–175, no. 27; {Lucas and Harris 1962}, pp. 124–127).

## Comments

In ancient Egypt glass inlays were often used as elements of decorative composite reliefs with figural scenes and inscriptions on shrines, statues and statuettes, mummies, mummy masks, coffins, and expensive furniture. They either protruded in relief or were placed in individual cells half- or completely sunk into the surface of the object. They appeared from the reign of Amenhotep III (1387–1350 BCE) ({Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994}, p. 143, comments on no. 11). Incrustation with glass inlays predominantly on wooden objects is known in Egypt throughout the Late Pharaonic and Ptolemaic periods (see comments on [2003.149](#cat), [2003.154](#cat); also, for a thorough recent overview, see {Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011}, pp. 350–395, esp. 350–353, 378; {Stern and Schlick-Nolte 1994}, pp. 376–385, 404–407, nos. 126–132, 146, 147; {Auth 1999}; {Nenna 2002}; {Antonaras 2012}, pp. 286–289, nos. 472–483). In the Augustan era, production of mosaic glass was transplanted from Egypt to Rome, and several new products appeared that imitated colorful types of marble, including finds from Rome and Patras, Greece ({Capriata 2005}, pp. 229–262; {Kolonas 2002}, p. 116, no. 17; {Antonaras 2012}, pp. 291–297, nos. 490–502). In addition, during the late first century BCE–early first century CE plaques with theatrical masks ([2003.260](#cat), [2004.27](#cat), [2004.28](#cat)), deities ([2003.264](#cat)), and floral compositions ([76.AF.70.1](#cat), [76.AF.70.3](#cat), [76.AF.70.5](#cat), [76.AF.70.6](#cat), [76.AF.70.12](#cat), [76.AF.70.20](#cat), [76.AF.70.25](#cat), [76.AF.70.28](#cat), [76.AF.70.29](#cat), [76.AF.70.30](#cat), [76.AF.70.34](#cat), [76.AF.70.37](#cat), [76.AF.70.38](#cat), [76.AF.70.40](#cat), [76.AF.70.41](#cat), [76.AF.70.42](#cat), [83.AF.28.21](#cat), [2004.26.2](#cat), [2004.26.5](#cat)) became fashionable, the latter occasionally interconnected/joined to form elongated bands ([2003.261](#cat), [2003.262](#cat), [2003.263](#cat), [2004.29](#cat), [2004.30](#cat), [2004.31](#cat)), all of the them used in incrustation. They are dated in the last half of the first century BCE–early first century CE, and they were made in Egypt or in Rome. There are 16 different iconographical types represented on these plaques with deities and theatrical masks: bull-Apis ([2003.264](#cat)), Thoth-ibis ([2003.158](#cat)), udjat-eyes, bird-Ba, Bes, Isis, Hathor, satyroi, silenoi, Dionysus ([2004.27](#cat)), concubines ([2004.28](#cat)), maenads, brother keeper, old servant. They are the most delicate and artistically adept products of ancient incrustation. They form a closely connected group that must have been products of one single center and made within a relatively short period of time ({Mahnke 2008}; {Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2011}, pp. 385–395).

Later on, mosaic glass vessels and glass incrustation became increasingly popular in Egypt and possibly in Rome as well, during the third through the fifth centuries CE, with published finds known from Rome, Ostia, Corinth, Kenchreai, and in Egypt proper, Fayum and Antinoöpolis as well. On them were depicted simpler geometrical patterns and more often complex, colorful representations of maritime ([2003.266](#cat), [76.AF.70.14](#cat), [76.AF.70.16](#cat)) and Nilotic scenes, figures of philosophers, and Christian iconographical themes as well ({Becatti 1969}; {Ibrahim, Scranton, and Brill 1976}, pp. 262–265; {Brill and Whitehouse 1988}; {Nenna 2002}; {Auth 2007}; {Silvano 2012}, p. 273, fig. 3, top; {Rassart-Debergh and Weidmann 2013}; {Kiilerich 2014}, pp. 179–181; {Antonaras 2022}, pp. 30, 71–73). The tradition of using colorful glass plaques in opus sectile decoration continued in the Byzantine Empire, known in sixth-century basilicas and in Middle Byzantine period (ninth–twelfth centuries) palaces ({Antonaras 2013}, p. 193, plate 13; {Antonaras 2018}).

The earliest glass inlays that appeared in Egypt, from at least the middle of the second millennium BCE, were made of brightly colored glass (see [2003.149](#cat), [2003.150](#cat), [2003.151](#cat), [2003.152](#cat), [2003.153](#cat)), and in the fourth century BCE mosaic canes were invented and introduced in inlays. Composite glass mosaic canes with miniature designs, such as rosettes and other floral motifs, checkers, imitations of stone with flakes or veins, masks, and deities, were made from bundled cold canes (e.g., [2003.265](#cat), [2003.258.7](#cat), [2004.26.4](#cat), [76.AF.70.35](#cat), [76.AF.20](#cat), [76.AF.70.27](#cat), [76.AF.70.32](#cat)). The motif was formed on their inside and was visible only in transverse sections. Slices of these prefabricated mosaic canes together with monochrome canes were heated and lengthened repeatedly, each time rendering the design smaller. These sections with geometrical or floral motifs were used to form larger mosaic inlays (for a longer section of such a bar see [76.AF.70.46](#cat)). They were placed face down on a mold and fused together; often the space between them was filled with monochrome glass chips that formed the background against which the motifs would stand out. These larger plaques occasionally have a backing of scraps of mosaic glass that provided extra strength and leveled out the individual sections ([76.AF.70.1](#cat), [76.AF.70.3](#cat), [76.AF.70.11](#cat), [76.AF.70.12](#cat), [76.AF.70.18](#cat), [76.AF.70.25](#cat), [76.AF.70.26](#cat), [76.AF.70.28](#cat), [76.AF.70.29](#cat), [76.AF.70.30](#cat), [76.AF.70.31](#cat), [76.AF.70.34](#cat), [76.AF.70.42](#cat), [83.AF.28.15a–b](#cat), [83.AF.28.21](#cat), [83.AF.28.23](#cat), [83.AF.28.25](#cat), [2004.26.2](#cat), [2004.26.4](#cat), [2004.26.5](#cat)). Finally, the front side of the plaque, which was dull because of its contact with the mold, had to be ground and polished in order to make it shiny and the colors bright. For the production technique of glass mosaics see {Dawes 2002} and comments on [85.AF.85](#cat). On the trade of small fragments of mosaic glass in nineteenth century and on the entries that different techniques and classes of mosaic glass present in the JPGM collection are discussed, see comment on [76.AF.70.21](#cat).
