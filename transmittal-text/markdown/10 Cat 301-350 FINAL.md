## Condition

Intact; some areas with iridescence, mostly on the neck and mouth area.

## Description

Fire-polished rim; wide conical mouth; cylindrical neck wider toward the conical body. Thick turquoise coil wound under the rim, and another at the base of the neck. The body bears nine vertical elongated indentations, which cover it almost entirely. The vessel ends in a small, pad base made of a thick coil of turquoise glass wound three times and pressed to a small pad base, similar to the toes of clay amphoras. A coil handle, made of greenish glass with remains of turquoise glass in its upper part, starts on the shoulder and ends on the mouth, which is mildly deformed at that spot.

## Comments

This jug has many common features with the distinctive group of Syro-Palestinian amphoras, free- and mold-blown ones dated to the fourth and fifth centuries CE ({Stern 1977}, pp. 84–85; {Stern 2001}, pp. 146–149, nos. 100–101). These common features, beginning with the characteristic color and quality of both green and turquoise glass, the shape of the base and the handle, the indentations along the body, and the decorative colored coil on the neck and under the rim, indicate that it was produced in the same workshop. For further comments on this production see [2003.414](#num).

## Description

Fire-polished rim; conical mouth; cylindrical neck, wider toward the body. Convex shoulders; conical body, standing on an irregular, pushed-in, and flattened ring-base. The lower part of the body is mildly distorted in one place due to some mishap in the formation of the base. A thick annular pontil mark (W. 2.2, Th. up to 0.7 cm) on the bottom. A strap handle, mostly purplish—only a small part is bluish-greenish—in a different hue than that of the body, starts on the shoulder, stretches almost vertically to the height of the rim, where it bends, and attaches on the mouth and under the rim. The edges of the handle appear to be raised due to a deep and wide groove that runs along the central part of the handle. One purplish coil is wound twice under the rim, and another one is wound once around the base of the neck.

## Comments and Comparanda

Jugs of this form are known among fourth-century vessels from western sites ({Isings 1957}, pp. 150–151, form 120b). In addition, dip mold–blown parallels are known mainly from the Balkans and Trier ({Antonaras 2017}, pp. 121–122, form 84), also dated to the fourth century CE.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; long, conical neck; globular body; slightly concave bottom. On the bottom a faint scar of a solid pontil (W. ca. 0.9 cm). Coil handle applied on the shoulder, stretched to the rim, where it is folded twice, forming a thumb rest extending beyond the rim. Decorated with applied, undulating trails: one trail horizontal on the shoulder, and three vertical trails arranged at equal distances around the body from the bottom to the shoulder.

## Comments and Comparanda

The use of turquoise blue coil in the decoration of bowls, and various forms of flasks and jugs, is typical for the Syrian region in the sixth–seventh centuries CE ({Jennings 2004/5}, pp. 155–168; {Foy 2000}, pp. 259–268, and particularly on jugs pp. 266–267).

No handled parallels have been located. The closest parallel is a bottle in the Metropolitan Museum of Art made of the same glass and bearing the same decoration; in color and shape it is dated to the seventh-eighth century (acc. no. x.21.178: <https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/442864>).

## Description

Flaring rim; short, conical mouth that leads directly to the ovular body. A thick coil is wound once around the lower end of the mouth at the transition to the body. The vessel stands on a flat bottom, where an annular pontil mark (W. 2.5 cm, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible. A strap handle was applied on the body and drawn up to the base of the mouth, covering the decorative coil there.

Body, handle, and the decorative coil are made of amber-colored glass with few pinprick bubbles in it. In addition, the vessel is covered with applied decoration. One white and one opaque red-brick thread wound nine times around the vessel, from the center of the bottom to the end of the rim. The threads are combed on body and neck, forming festoons.

## Comments and Comparanda

The same decoration of a fine red trail dragged to form festoons appears on vessels from the Syro-Palestinian region from the fourth up to the eighth century CE; see comments on [2003.289](#num). The dark translucent color and the thick walls of the body connect it with jars dated to the seventh–eighth centuries (e.g., {Whitehouse 2014}, pp. 194, nos. 940–941). For other parallels see: {Metropolitan Museum of Art 1930}, p. 111 (not illustrated); a jar (acc. no. 29.100.89.) dated in the fifth century CE or later: <https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/253001>; {Platz-Horster 1976}, pp. 92–93, nos. 183–186, flasks in different shapes and an amphoriskos dated in fourth–fifth or seventh–eighth century CE; {Oliver 1980}, p. 139, no. 240, globular jar dated in the seventh–eighth century CE; {Whitehouse 2001a}, pp. 212–213, nos. 777–778, a bottle, fourth–fifth century CE, and a jar dated in the fifth century CE, or later; {Carboni and Whitehouse 2001}, pp. 136–137, no. 53, a cylindrical bottle ascribed to Egypt or Syria; the same in {Carboni 2001}, pp. 296–297, no. 75a, dated in the eighth, possibly early ninth century CE.

## Description

Rim folded out, down, and up. Cylindrical neck, sloping shoulders, square body, flat bottom. A smooth strap handle of the same material is attached on the shoulder and bent at a right angle, ending at upper neck area below the rim. Three concentric circular ridges (Diam. 1.5, 3.5, 5 cm) are faintly visible on three sides of the body—possibly remains of the mold used to shape the sides, or probably the result of the uneven cooling down of the glass. As none of the body edges are straight and the sides are quite different, the vessel may be either a crooked mold-blown product or a free-blown product.

## Description

Wide, in-folded rim, flaring to form a conical mouth; short, rudimentary neck; globular body; conical, pushed-in base; flat, slightly concave bottom. No pontil mark visible on bottom, as is normal for these vessels. Massive, M-shaped handles have been applied at the shoulders, beginning from left and ending at right.

## Comments

Lidded, large-sized glass vessels with wide neck, usually with two heavy, M-, U-, or omega-shaped handles but occasionally handleless or single-handled, were used as cinerary urns in Roman time, during the late first and throughout the second century CE. The ashes of cremated Romans were placed in them, and usually they were placed in a marble or lead case to avoid fracture and the consequent spilling of the human remains. These glass receptacles were mostly unearthed in the western Roman provinces, where the custom of cremation was prevalent, or at eastern Mediterranean sites with direct connections to the west.

Each handle starts from the neck, forming a tiny thumb rest on the top, and stretches, forming a fine curve that ends on the upper body. A fine thread starting on the shoulder is wound seven times around the shoulders and the lower part of the neck. No pontil mark visible on the bottom.

## Comparanda

Flasks with three feet with flat, band-like pinched toes are well-known from the first century (considered to be Italian products: see {Stern 1976}, pp. 53–54, no. 13; {De Tommaso 1991}, p. 54, type 25; {Lightfoot 2017}, p. 188, no. 229). Simpler pinched toes are known from the second–third centuries CE ({Antonaras 2012}, p. 213, no. 320). A fourth-century amphoriskos with identical toes is in the collection of the Allard Pierson Museum, Amsterdam (no. 6069).

The body is made of amber-colored glass, and on its lower part some darker, probably purplish, striations are visible. A high, coil handle made of dark green with a few opaque red striations is applied on the rim and rises, forming a trapezoidal arch. On one end a curly ending of the coil is left on the rim.

## Comparanda

This is a rare type of bowl, with a tall, vertical handle that gives it an overall shape similar to a bucket. A similar vessel, standing on three toes and not on a conical base, is in the Louvre, acquired in Syria and dated in the third century CE ({Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 376, no. 998). In addition, cylindrical, bucket-shaped vessels standing on their bottom are known from the Syro-Palestinian region: two from Hammat Gader ({Cohen 1997}, p. 411, plate IV:1–2); possibly also another in Jalame ({Weinberg 1988}, p. 82, no. 369, fig. 4-42); one in the Israel Museum ({Israeli 2003}, p. 291, no. 385); another appeared in an auction in New York ({Fortuna 2002}, no. 123).

## Condition

White incrustation in the interior; very few signs of weathering on the exterior.

## Description

Fire-polished, horizontal rim; short and very wide neck; squat globular body; conical, applied, and tooled base. The base is partly irregular, and slanting tooling marks are visible on it. A fine blue thread is wound four times around the neck, starting from the upper shoulder. Thirteen dark blue coil handles around the rim, each starting on the shoulder and ending with a bend on the edge of the rim. Part of a pontil mark is visible on the bottom, off-center.

## Comments and Comparanda

In Levantine glass production the use of bent trails forming zigzags covering the area between the shoulders and the neck of jars is common in the fourth and fifth centuries ({Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 34, types VI:9, 10; {Antonaras 2012}, pp. 205–206, nos. 302–304). In the same spirit, contemporaneous jars are adorned with many handles around the neck; these are made of individual lengths of glass, often in a different color from the body. Parallels include the following: {Abdul Hak 1965}, p. 31, fig. 14; {Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 34, type VI:20; {Matheson 1980}, no. 315; {Stern 2001}, no. 126; {Arvellier-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 425, no. 1185, plate 107, example without base; {Arvellier-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 425, no. 1187, plate 107, example with three pinched toes; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 205, no. 301.

This form of jar, with the characteristic flange at mid-height of the neck, is widely distributed in the Syro-Palestinian region, known in examples with globular and ovular body occasionally decorated with applied threads, indentations, or dip mold–blown or pinched ribs. The flange indicates that these jars were not used for drinking or pouring liquids ({Stern 2001}, pp. 150–151).

Dimensions: H. 9, max. Diam. 7.9, Diam. rim 6.4, Diam. base 4.1 cm; Wt. 73.67 g

Date: Sixth–seventh century CE

Start_date: 500

End_date: 699

Attribution: Production area: Eastern Mediterranean

Culture: Roman

Material: Transparent greenish and turquoise glass

Modeling technique and decoration: Free-blown; applied elements

Inscription: No

Shape: Jars

Technique: Free-blown

## Condition

Part of the rim has been replaced with resin. Most of the surface is weathered, giving the vessel iridescence and an opaque, whitish layer.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring almost horizontal rim. Wide, cylindrical neck; globular body, standing on a conical, pushed-in base. Two tiny ring handles are applied on the shoulder, stretched upward, forming a curve and folded over upon themselves; one is made of a turquoise glass. A turquoise thread is applied to the underside of the rim so that it can be seen through the colorless glass of the rim. At the center of the bottom there is an annular pontil scar (W. 1.5, Th. 0.2 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

This jar is quite unusual in the shape and size of its two handles. Early Imperial jars are almost always handleless and without a base (see {Isings 1957}, pp. 81–88, forms 63–68; {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 131–136, forms 98–110, and comments on [80.AF.125](#num)). Also, the majority of Late Roman jars do not have handles, and those that do have thick, large handles, often several of them around the neck (see comments on [2003.398](#num), [2003.411](#num), [78.AF.25](#num), [2003.400](#num)). Small ring handles, almost always three in number, are known on bowl lamps from the fifth century onward ({Isings 1957}, p. 162, form 134; {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 63, 84, forms 13, 36; {Antonaras 2022}, pp. 31–33, 56, nos. 260–263). The particular hue of the turquoise thread seems identical to the one used in Syrian products of the sixth–seventh centuries. See comments on [2003.452](#num).

## Condition

Intact. Large portions of the thread are missing and only the cavities where it originally lay are visible. Small areas with iridescent weathering, especially on the rim.

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; long cylindrical neck, wider toward the squat, bulbous body, which is standing on a flat, slightly concave bottom.

A white thread of glass has been spirally wound 16 times from the center of the bottom to the rim and dragged up five times, forming a pattern of festoons on the upper body and neck area.

## Comments and Comparanda

The fusion of the thread into the body of the vessel was achieved by applying it at an early stage of the blowing and marvering it before the vessel was given its final dimensions.

This form of small flask, known also as an unguentarium or balsamarium, is quite common both in the east and the west in the first half of the first century CE. They appear either undecorated or with spirally wound trails, more often marvered flush with the surface.

## Description

In-folded and flattened rim; cylindrical neck, constricted twice at its base; elongated piriform body; flat bottom. A white thread of glass has been spirally wound six times from the bottom to the rim and dragged upward two times, forming an irregular feather pattern. The thread is considerably wider on the lower part of the vessel and finer on the neck. The thread was probably applied on the initial bubble and became wider at the lower part of the body because it expanded more. On the bottom a projection of a tiny part of the same multicolored glass is visible, as well as another one that is barely visible, both probably pontil marks (W. ca. 1.7 cm).

## Comments and Comparanda

This form of small piriform flask is quite common in both the east and the west in the first half of the first century CE. They appear either undecorated or with spirally wound trails, more often marvered flush with the surface.

## Description

In-folded and flattened, flaring rim; in its current state short neck; biconical body. A white trail of glass has been spirally wound ca. 15 times from the bottom to the rim and dragged upward four times, forming an irregular feathering pattern. The trail was tooled and melted flush with the vessel surface. The neck originally probably was much longer, as it is in all cited parallels.

## Comments and Comparanda

Tear- or drop-shaped flasks for unguents are a relatively widespread form of unguentarium, dated in the first century CE. This particular variant is considered to be an eastern Mediterranean product. They are either plain or decorated with a fine thread of glass either left in relief, like [2003.415](#num) and [2003.416](#num), or marvered flush, like 2003.286.

Published examples include several plain ones from: Pompeii ({Scatozza Höricht 2012}, p. 140, no. 11294A, plate XXVIII); Venice ({Larese 2004}, no. 393, plate XI); Cyprus ({McFadden 1946}, p. 486, no. 114, plate 45; {Vessberg 1952}, p. 141, plate IX:30); Amphipolis ({Weinberg 1963}, pp. 1–2); Palestine ({Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, type XXII:2); Adana region ({Stern 1989}, p. 590, fig. 10:5–8); Amorgos ({Weinberg and McClellan 1992}, pp. 115–116, no. 80); Aquileia ({Mandruzzato and Marcante 2007}, pp. 104, 139, nos. 289–290); unprovenanced ({Antonaras 2012}, p. 214, no. 323).

In addition, unprovenanced examples decorated with a trail left in relief are reported from several museums: {Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 170, no. 702; {3000 Jahre Glaskunst}, p. 220, no. 638; {Bomford 1976}, p. 20, no. 57; {Fleming 1999}, p. 30; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 214, no. 324.

Parallels with trails marvered and dragged upwards include the following unprovenanced examples: {Stern 2001}, p. 62, no. 6; {Matheson 1980}, pp. 24–25, no. 65; {Oliver 1980}, pp. 52, 56, nos. 37–38.

## Comments and Comparanda

Piriform flasks with spiraling thread around the body and pinched ribs are a well-known form in the first century CE ({Isings 1957}, pp. 40, form 26b). It has been proposed that they originate from the eastern Mediterranean and were copied in Italy ({De Tommaso 1990}, pp. 53–54, type 24). Published examples from sites like Cologne ({Fremersdorf 1961}, p. 40, plate 60); Trier ({Goethert-Polaschek 1977}, form 70c, pp. 114–115, nos. 618–619, plate 1:4d, 8:94d); Aquileia ({Mandruzzato and Marcante 2007}, p. 77, no. 129, p. 36 color ill.); Marone ({Facchini 2007}, pp. 69–70, no. 114); Cyzicus ({Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 276, no. 826); Dura-Europos ({Clairmont 1963}, p. 47, no. 179, plate 23); and museum collections, such as the Yale Art Gallery ({Matheson 1980}, p. 27, nos. 72–73); Stuttgart ({Stern 2001}, p. 63, no. 7).

## Condition

## Description

Horizontal, in-folded, and flattened rim; long, cylindrical neck, slightly constricted at its base; conical body; concave base. At the center of the bottom a circular pontil mark (W. 1.7, Th. 0.5 cm) is visible. White, marvered trail spirally wound five times, before the final expansion of the vessel, decorates the body and neck of the flask.

## Comments and Comparanda

Vessels in this form of flask—with the extremely long neck compared to the short, conical body—are known as “Candlestick Unguentaria,” and they are widely present in the eastern Mediterranean from the late first to the second century CE ({Isings 1957}, pp. 97–98, form 82.A.2, Karanis class XIII.A.1.; {Antonaras 2017}, pp. 152–154, form 131). In most cases these are plain, undecorated vessels (e.g., {Whitehouse 1997a}, p. 154, no. 263; {Whitehouse 2003}, p. 142, no. 1135), but there are decorated examples like 2003.283 with a spirally wound, opaque white thread that was marvered flush to the surface, datable in the late first and second centuries CE. An almost identical flask, probably from Egypt, is now in the Corning Museum of Glass (53.1.27, {Whitehouse 2001a}, p. 209, no. 773).

A fine white thread was spirally wound 18 times from the middle of the neck to the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

Bulbous and globular unguentaria appear from the early first century CE, and during the same century they become one of the most widespread forms of flask, known in both the eastern and the western Roman provinces ({Stern 1977}, p. 35; {De Tommaso 1990}, pp. 39–40, type 5). They are often decorated with spirally wound threads, more often than not left unmarvered ({Antonaras 2017}, p. 146, form 122a, wherein several parallels are cited). For additional parallels see {Dusenbery 1967}, p. 41, nos. 16, 17, figs. 17–18; {Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 41, type XV:1-1; {Stern 2001}, p. 57, no. 1; {Israeli 2003}, p. 116, no. 103; {Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna 2005}, p. 201, no. 564; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 212, no. 317.

## Condition

Fully preserved. A small, repaired break on the lip, and very few nicks and scratches. Large areas covered with weathering.

## Description

In-folded, slightly everted rim; cylindrical neck with a horizontal constriction at the transition to the ovular body, which is standing on a folded, tubular ring-base; the bottom is slightly concave. An anomaly or a semi-annular fold on the undersurface could be interpreted as a pontil scar, yet the constriction at the bottom of the neck indicates that the rim was shaped while it was held with pincers/jacks from the neck.

## Comparanda

Small-size flasks with ovular body are one of the most widely appearing forms during the first century CE ({Vessberg 1952}, plate VII:27; {Isings 1957}, form 28a (variant); {Barag 1970a}, vol. 2, plate 44, type XVI:4; {Stern 1977}, pp. 38–41, no. 8; {De Tommaso 1990}, p. 81, type 67; {Antonaras 2012}, p. 211, no. 314). Opaque red, or white, like [2003.243](#num), unguentaria are known in the first century CE. The base-ring of 2003.242 is set apart, bringing it closer to the form of elongated flask known from Aquileia, Italy ({De Tommaso 1990}, p. 81, type 66; {Mandruzzato and Marcante 2007}, p. 100, no. 269) and eastern Mediterranean sites, dated in the second–third centuries CE ({Vessberg 1956}, p. 151, plate 47:28; {Clairmont 1963}, p. 140, no. 743, plate XVI).

Flasks with a constriction at mid-height or at the upper third of their ovular or pear-shaped body are a well-known form mainly in the eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean area, and occasionally in Italy too, during the second half of the first and into the early second century CE {Vessberg 1952}, plate VII:35, 36; {Hayes 1975}, p. 69, no. 2115, fig. 8, plate 16; {De Tommaso 1990}, p. 87, type 76; {Dusenbery 1998}, p. 1105, no.

## Description

In-folded, tubular, flaring rim; short neck; ovular body compressed at four spots along its greatest diameter, thereby acquiring an irregularly polygonal shape. Stands on a concave bottom. No signs of pontil mark are visible.

## Comments and Comparanda

A well-known form ascribed to the production of fourth-century eastern workshops is the group of relatively small flasks with tubular, in-folded rim and a very wide, short, cylindrical neck leading to a pear-shaped body that almost always bears four indentations that render the body squarish ({Stern 1977}, pp. 100–101, no. 28; {Barkóczi 1988}, p. 151, form 131; {Roffia 1993}, p. 108; {Antonaras 2017}, p. 133, form 102). Analogous items have been located in the following sites and museums: Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto ({Hayes 1975}, pp. 39, 66, plate 12, no. 153); Mainz ({Harter 1999}, pp. 104, 246, form D21b, no. 726, plate 30); Syria: Bosra ({Dussart 1998}, p. 92, form BVII.2423, plate 18); Israel: Samaria ({Crowfoot 1957}, p. 409, no. 5, fig. 94/5) and Jordan: Mahayy ({Dussart 1998}, p. 92 n. 7).

The flask was acquired with a leather-covered lidded basket, and both are part of a group of miscellaneous objects once associated with a painted wood sarcophagus ([82.AP.75](https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/105Z1T)). The absence of sediments on the glass vessel and the shape of the basket, which does not correspond to that of the flask but quite faithfully renders a first-century mold-blown pyxis like [2003.315](#num), suggest that they were not an original assemblage.

Shape: Flasks

Technique: Free-blown

## Condition

Mended; a concealed join at the transition from the neck to the body. Iridescence on the exterior, incrustation on the interior. Pastiche (XRF and visual observation suggest the neck and body are from two different objects).

## Description

Fire-polished, flaring rim; cylindrical neck; globular body; slightly concave bottom. A circular mark of a solid pontil (W. 0.8 cm) at the center of the bottom.

## Comments and Comparanda

The neck belonged to a taller unguentarium, either tear-shaped (e.g., {Isings 1957}, p. 24, form 8; {Antonaras 2017}, p. 149, form 126a) or, more probably, conical ({Antonaras 2017}, pp. 151–152, forms 128, 130), forms generally dated in the first and second centuries CE.

The body, which is made of a darker shade of green, belongs to a smaller globular unguentarium, a form that appears already from the early third, become popular in the fourth, and survives into the fifth century ({Isings 1957}, p. 120, miniature version of form 101; {Antonaras 2017}, p. 157, form 139).

## Description

Fire-polished, horizontal rim with a cutout fold beneath it, giving the impression of an applied coil. Short and wide neck ending in a diaphragm; pear-shaped body, standing on a mildly concave bottom. An annular pontil mark (W. 2, Th. 0.1 cm) is visible on its bottom. Around the body four deep, vertical indentations.

## Comments and Comparanda

Sprinklers, or dropper flasks, emerge before the middle of the third century CE and stand out among the extremely diverse fourth-century CE Syrian glass production. They are usually flasks of different shapes, amphoriskoi, tubes, animal- and head-shaped flasks but also jars. They have in common the diaphragm at the base of their neck that allowed the content—apparently some costly liquid, oil or perfume—to exit one drop at the time. It has been proposed that the reference in Jewish sources to a “flask whose brim is squashed inside it” refers to sprinklers (Tosefta Miqva’ot 6\[7\]:22 cited in {Israeli 2003}, p. 222). They were often decorated with expanded geometric motifs blown in full-size molds. Sprinklers were made in Syria, eastern Palestine, and Mesopotamia, although they appear occasionally in other regions too ({Stern 1977}, pp. 95–100; {Stern 2001}, pp. 133–134, 152–153; {Dussart 1998}, pp. 161–162, types BXII.211, 212, 2131, 2132, 22). The earliest examples from Dura-Europos predate the destruction of the city in 256 CE ({Clairmont 1963}, pp. 104–106, no. 486–503, plate XII). The finds from the cemetery at Tell Mahuz in Mesopotamia are dated to the third–fourth centuries ({Negro Ponzi 1984}, pp. 33–40). For sprinkler flasks of the same form, with snake-thread decoration, see [2003.437](#num) and [2003.438](#num), and with pinched fins see [2004.42](#num).

Material: Translucent greenish glass. Black crust and iridescence, cracks

Modeling technique and decoration: Free-blown; applied elements, pinched

Inscription: No

Shape: \[Sprinklers, Flasks\]

Technique: Free-blown

## Condition

Fully preserved, but heavily weathered. Has such strong iridescence that it is difficult to discern the original color, but the glass may have originally been colorless.

## Description

Fire-polished rim, conical mouth; wide, short neck with a constriction at its base that forms a diaphragm; piriform body; flat, slightly convex bottom. The short, fine base-ring hardly covers the curve of the bottom. At the center of the bottom a crescent-shape pontil mark (W. ca. 1 cm) is visible.

The body is decorated with snake-thread decoration formed by a thread with horizontal ridges. The one continuous thread, forming a wide triangle at the start—probably rendering the snake’s head—is wavy, with two rows of higher coils dividing the vessel’s body into three parts, ending with a high coil above the serpent’s “head.”
